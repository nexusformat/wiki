The Instrument Definition for the Muon instruments has evolved from that
proposed in 2001 to the more robust definition outlined in the linked
discussion document (<Media:Muon_V2R7.pdf>).

For completeness both are discussed in this document; however, the NIAC
are asked to vote on and ratify the 'Muon Instrument Definition: Version
2 - pulsedTD'

Aspects of the Muon Definition either introduce new NeXus Classes or
extend existing definitions. These are discussed separately in the
linked document (<Media:Elements_for_Muons.pdf>), and the NIAC are asked
to separately consider and ratify these elements that are key to the
Muon definition.
