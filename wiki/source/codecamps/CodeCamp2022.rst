      .. rubric:: NeXus Code Camp - June 2022
         :name: nexus-code-camp---june-2022
         :class: page-title

      The 2022 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for the week of June 13-17th
      and will focus on fixing issues to meet the next release
      milestone.

      At some point during the week, we must decide what issues and pull
      requests in the definitions repository will be finished by the end
      of this Code Camp for inclusion in the next release **this
      month**. All unfinished issues and PRs for this milestone of the
      definitions repository will be moved to the next milestone.

      .. rubric:: Issues and pull requests
         :name: issues-and-pull-requests

      To help the upcoming code camp organize and track its work, a
      GitHub project has been created. You can `add additional issues
      and pull
      requests <https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen>`__
      by dragging each to the "To do" column. The list is filled from
      any of the repositories that are connected to the project. As a
      start, existing open pull requests were added to the appropriate
      column based on inspection of the comments in each.

      If you have some other matter to add, create an issue in the
      appropriate repository and then you can add it to this project. If
      it should be considered for the next release of the definitions
      repository, add the issue (or pull request) to the `NXDL
      2022.06 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/12>`__

      .. rubric:: Meetings Schedule
         :name: meetings-schedule

      Regular video meetings will be run over the course of the week of
      June 13-17th in order to aid communication. Since we spread over
      the globe, our normal work schedules are not going to overlap
      perfectly and participants are encouraged to attend whichever
      sessions reasoably fit their own work/life schedule. Sessions
      **B** and **D** provide the best opportunities to get everyone
      together and participants are encouraged to make an effort to join
      these sessions.

      All sessions will use the same Zoom meeting:
