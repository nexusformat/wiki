      The 2020-2 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for 2 days in October
      2020: October 19 (Monday) - 20 (Tuesday). It is taking place one
      week after the `2020 NIAC
      meeting <../niac/NIAC2020.html>`__. It was
      originally planned to be immediately after the `NOBUGS 2020
      conference <https://tiny.cc/nobugs2020>`__, hosted by the
      `European XFEL <https://www.xfel.eu/>`__, but NOBUGS has been
      postponed and the 2020 NIAC become an online meeting.

      .. rubric:: Purpose
         :name: purpose

      The Monday of the Code Camp will be primarily an open help session
      for people to ask detailed questions and request specific help
      from core NeXus developers, e.g. writing an application definition
      or writing a NeXus file correctly. The Tuesday will be more for
      the core NeXus developers to work on implementing `NIAC
      decisions <../niac/NIAC2020.html>`__

      If you have a topic you wish to discuss/cover in the Monday code
      camp, please add it as a comment to this `GitHub
      issue <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues/38>`__

      NeXus periodically convenes a Code Camp to develop NeXus software
      components through intense effort by small groups working on
      specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those attending
      the Monday Code Camp session will already have a strong foundation
      and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready
      with knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress
      during the event.

      (For more info on code camps, try searching Google for "code camp"
      or "codeathon". Events such as the `EPICS
      Codeathon <https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php>`__
      would be reasonable templates for this NeXus code camp.)

      Registration for the NIAC and code camp is not required.
