      Develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small
      groups working on specific projects and tasks. It is expected that
      those attending the 2009 NeXus Code Camp will already have strong
      foundation and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and
      come ready with knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant
      progress during the event. The specific projects and tasks, as
      well as the list of participants, are described on this wiki and
      will be revised as the event draws near.

      (For more info on code camps, try searching Google for "code camp"
      or "codeathon". Events such as the `EPICS
      Codeathon <http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php>`__
      would be reasonable templates for this first NeXus code camp.)
