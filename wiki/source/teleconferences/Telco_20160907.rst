      AB may have an issue to bring up with NXprocess. Could use some
      preparation. Will discuss more detailed proceeding in the next
      Telco.

      .. rubric:: NAPI update
         :name: napi-update

      .. rubric:: Report from Basel
         :name: report-from-basel

      Dectris and their users have reaffirmed their commitment to NXmx.
      All looks promising. A recently published article by Dectris
      mentions storing data in some BioHDF format. That appears to be
      some editorial mistake. We   ve been promised some more information

      .. rubric:: HDF Group
         :name: hdf-group

      No reply from the HDF group on participation in the code camp or
      NIAC.

      .. rubric:: NeXus remote object servers
         :name: Telco_20160907_nexus-remote-object-servers

      Ray presented the concepts of his successful project to serve a
      sliceable NeXus file across the network. Useful in cases where you
      don   t want or need all the data locally. We discussed the relative
      merits of doing that at the NeXus level or in plain HDF5 and also
      how relevant the use case is to all science areas. There is also
      the competing idea that the data stays remote and the algorithm or
      visualisation is sent to the place holding the data. A further
      idea is to have persistent global identifiers to the data(sets),
      similar to external links. Across the network and curated like
      DOIs. We can discuss how much we as    NeXus    want to be part of
      defining such an infrastructure. Possibly at the NIAC or code
      camp.
