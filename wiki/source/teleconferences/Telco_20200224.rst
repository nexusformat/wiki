      -  2020 NIAC and Code Camp dates surrounding
         `NOBUGS2020 <https://indico.desy.de/indico/event/24321/overview>`__
         (Oct. 14-16). `Proposed
         dates <https://doodle.com/poll/7c39uppbs7qwsveh>`__ are:

         -  NIAC meeting on Oct. 12-13th (i.e. Monday-Tuesday just
            before NOBUGS)
         -  Code Camp on either Oct. 10-11th, or 17-18th (i.e. weekend
            before, or after)

      .. rubric:: NIAC
         :name: Telco_20200224_niac

      -  All agreed that the NIAC tradition is to meet together with
         NOBUGS and that there is no alternatives being proposed.
      -  All agreed that Oct. 12-13th is the obvious best choice for
         dates adjacent to NOBUGS2020.

      .. rubric:: Code Camp
         :name: Telco_20200224_code-camp

      -  MK suggested that Oct. 19-20th could be better dates to avoid
         working over the weekend. BW would rather not lengthen the
         travel further than necessary.
      -  All agreed that after the NIAC made more sense than before
         since it would allow enacting NIAC decisions.
      -  BW suggested that we could advertise the Code Camp as an
         opportunity for software developers (i.e. NOBUGS attendees) to
         work through practical NeXus-related problems together with the
         experts.
      -  After some discussion, all agreed that Oct 17-18th was the
         better choice.

      -  BW disappointed in attendence, considering lots of people
         answered the poll to decide the telco date. Perhaps this
         highlights the importance of the Outlook calendar event that
         was forgotten this time.
      -  Next telco to aim for mid March.
