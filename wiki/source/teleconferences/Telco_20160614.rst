      The two issues itemised above are resolved by the general
      agreement on being permissive with base classes. That is while
      base classes aim to cover most use cases, they don   t list all
      acceptable groups and fields. In order to be able to progress the
      standard additional data is acceptable. Validation tools should
      not treat such additional items not covered by a base class as
      errors, but notes or warnings. Users should encouraged to find the
      best defined location for their information, but we understand
      there is not a defined place for all possible data.

      This may require clarification in the manual.

      Related to that: cnxvalidate currently does no validation for
      files that do not (claim to) conform to an application definition.
      Just checking the use of base classes is another important use
      case. MK opened a ticket to investigate.

      Issue 330 (definitions): Comments left on the ticket. Partial
      action required at most. Could be resolved at the next NIAC.

      PJ shared his latest python project:

      It does similar things to cnxvalidate plus additional tooling.
