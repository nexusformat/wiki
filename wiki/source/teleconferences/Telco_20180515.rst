      All is ready to go ahead with the release. We merged three final
      tickets in the meeting and PJ is doing the remaining manual steps
      probably today.

      Ambitious plan for the next release was August. That way we have
      two releases a year and can get some known issues out of the way
      before the NIAC meeting. Release after that should be early next
      year, which allows time address new things that may come out of
      the NIAC.

      Resent communications indicated that NOBUGS may not happen on the
      dates originally circulated. We do not rule out having the NIAC at
      either dates, but would like clarity soon. People at BNL have been
      contacted to help.
