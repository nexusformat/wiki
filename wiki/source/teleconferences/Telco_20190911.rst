         :name: release

      Release issues to be worked on before we make the next release:
      https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/8

      -  Aim for February/March release.
      -  Why are
         `PDB <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/614/files>`__
         and
         `NXptycho <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/628/files>`__
         not visible in the current master

         -  they **are** in current master but neither are in
            applications
         -  `base/NXpdb <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/blob/master/base_classes/NXpdb.nxdl.xml>`__
         -  `contributed_definitions/NXcxi_ptycho <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/blob/master/contributed_definitions/NXcxi_ptycho.nxdl.xml>`__
            `Release
            Procedure <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/wiki/Release-Procedure>`__

      AB points out that his recent changes to
      `NXmx <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/commit/6e837341abbe3f61a68b65f6d441f9f77c4228de>`__
      adds further detail to beam_center_x and beam_center_y than is
      present in
      `NXdetector <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXdetector.html>`__.
      BW responded that while it is not ideal to have diverging
      documentation, an application definition can make some deviations
      when needed.

      .. rubric:: Prune Stale Branches
         :name: prune-stale-branches

      Branches that are not ahead of master at all give no value and
      have now been deleted.

      .. rubric:: Code Camp
         :name: Telco_20190911_code-camp

      Maybe PJ can organise something at Argonne in mid-November.
      Otherwise we should organise a virtual event. We certainly should
      do plenty of cleaning up in github for the next release.

      .. rubric:: HDF5 Workshop
         :name: Telco_20190911_hdf5-workshop

      No further specific issues.

      .. rubric:: Other Business
         :name: Telco_20190911_other-business

      -  SC to get some more graphic design input for a new logo,
         especially with more "corporate" colours and including a mu.
      -  Next meeting aiming for mid-October.
