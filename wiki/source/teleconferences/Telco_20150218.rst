      NXdetector origin and depends_on clarified. Herbert sent out an
      email to the discussion list: Depends_on point to the centre of
      any object unless otherwise specified. The most important (and
      only for the moment)    otherwise specified    case being NXdetector,
      where the depends_on locates the first pixel. The first one being
      the first one in the data. Otherwise there is some documentation
      missing or not sufficiently referenced in the manual describing
      the CIF geometry. To that end Ticket 273 is assigned to Tobias for
      now.

      NAPI release, Code Camp & Logo: Not discussed due to lack of
      relevant people.

      AOB: SNS representative elected, email will go out shortly. Use of
      application definitions should be surveyed more frequently, could
      come out of feature development.

      Next meeting will be `Telco 20150302 <Telco_20150302.html>`__
