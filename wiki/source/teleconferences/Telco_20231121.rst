         merge conflict to be resolved in NXdata
      -  NXmx gain discussion:

         -  AB: SACLA wants to use NXmx with a special gain calibration
            method which does not fit to the currently described way
            (see issue #711)
         -  WdN: scaling factor to support the requested function is
            defined in NXdata
         -  BW: offset first vs. scaling first
         -  HB: more exact definitions needed which include equation for
            clarity
         -  BW: another alternative: NXdetector/acquisition_mode
            [decimated]
