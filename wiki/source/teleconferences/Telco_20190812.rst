      -  BW has written a short article in wikipedia about NeXus and
         invites comments:

         -  "Domain specific ontology" is a major feature
         -  Application definitions define strictness for each
            implementation of a NeXus format
         -  Should add an example file structure

      -  BW to work on including these.

      -  PJ added this item to the agenda, but was not present at the
         meeting so we are not sure what he wanted to discuss.

      -  HB will be at ECM32 in Vienna next week to discuss NXmx Eiger
         format.
      -  Next meeting to be in the beginning of September.
      -  We have been having fewer telco participants than have been
         indicated in the polls - technical problems or just overly busy
         people
