      Deferred discussion on new pull request by RO (#602) until people
      had a chance to look at it.

      Agreed **target** attributes should not have mandatory values
      defined in application definitions. That rules out working with
      subentries. Ticket #600. MK agreed to implement a workaround in
      the validation tool until the NIAC has formally edited the
      application definitons.

      Adding z_pixel_offset (#591) agreed to merge and get NIAC approval
      later. Backward compatible change.

      Some discussions around RO's pull request:

      -  specifying both \_errors and @uncertainties should be avoided.
         This should be clarified in the documentation.
      -  data collected on irregular grids may leave you in situations
         where plotting with proper x and y axis is not straightforward
         or possible.
      -  with the versioning reaching maturity it will be possible to
         eventually delete things of base classes or application
         definition, as opposed to marking things deprecated. We're not
         yet in this state but that is a goal.
