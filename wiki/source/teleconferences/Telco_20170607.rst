      Most urgent problems:

      -  Missing Readme (should detail purpose and origin of the code)
      -  LZ4 test failure
      -  Top level build instructions (CMake)

      Nice pull request created by AB. Discussed some documentation
      issues and technical improvement. Easy to get to a finished state
      soon, except maybe for the flags.

      .. rubric:: NXcontainer
         :name: Telco_20170607_nxcontainer

      MW created a pull request in exampledata with files to illustrate
      the ideas, which have changed from the original proposal. We
      didn"t have time to look at them in detail. Will discuss next
      time.

      MW also has a pull request for NXstage, which is quite similar to
      NXtransformations. There was potential need identified for
      grouping certain instrument devices, but that may lead to slightly
      arbitrary grouping, based on personal preference. Depending on
      location, funciton, motion, etc. We"ll pick up the discussion next
      time again.
