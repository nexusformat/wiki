      .. rubric:: Updates for NXmx and base classes
         :name: updates-for-nxmx-and-base-classes

      HJB and AM want the files written by the Eiger2 to include extra
      information that clashes with what is currently described by NXDL.
      Specifically, the 'mask' field in NXdetector and NXmx is declared
      as type 'boolean   , but a more complex bit mask is required.
      Further, what is preferred and what is deprecated needs to be
      clearly communicated. NXDL currently allows an application
      definition to list an item twice, but with    minoccur=1    attribute
      in each to indicate that only one of the options should be
      present. BW proposes that an extra attribute in the NXDL tag, e.g.
      priority, could take an integer value to indicate which version
      is preferred and perhaps a negative integer could indicate
      deprecation.

      HJB and AM would like to promote discussion of possible solutions
      for now, but strongly desire the issue be settled before the
      summer conference season so that the decision can be clearly
      communicated.

      P.S. The currentl published versions of
      `NXmx <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXmx.html#nxmx>`__
      and
      `NXdetector <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXdetector.html#nxdetector>`__
      both provide a    pixel_mask    field that takes a 32-bit pixel mask
      (and have for over 5 years), so this issue seems to be just about
      clearly communicating the    old way    vs    new way   .

      .. rubric:: Variant scheme
         :name: variant-scheme

      HJB wants an agreed way to update the value of a field (keeping
      track of previous values). MK pointed out the `variant
      attribute <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/645>`__
      that was decided in the 2014 NIAC, but not yet properly
      documented.

      .. rubric:: Telco meeting times
         :name: telco-meeting-times

      BW proposes that further meetings be held 1.5 hours earlier than
      the current meeting (3pm CET, instead of 4:30pm CET) so that TM
      and others in Japan can attend the meeting at 11pm local time.
      Those who are adversely affected (such as Californians who will
      have to observe the telco at 6am) are encouraged to provide
      comments.

      BW agreed to organise the next telco using another poll, aiming
      for the beginning of March. `Poll for March
