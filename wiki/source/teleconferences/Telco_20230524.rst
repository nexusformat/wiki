      -  Next NIAC 2024 with NOBUGS at ESRF

      -  | https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1262
         | AB: bit_depth of image as metadat to be added
         | HB: proposal in 2012 for adding all datatype info as metadata
           (not only as hdf property)
         | PM: what to do if duplicated info (NeXus metadata vs. hdf
           metadata) has mismatch
         | AB: raise error
         | BW: it was not a problem for long time, so if problem does
           not come, we could just use the system as it is now.
         | NeXus as container agnostic solution, we could add.
         | SB: let introduce it to the base class NXdetector
         | AB: let us vote for it in June
         | SB: if data type needs to be registered (signed, unsigned,
           big/little endin, 8/16/32/' bit etc.), also multi dimensional
           slow/fast axes needs to be specified. Do we suggest it for
           any Field, Attribute
         | AB: here we focus on NXdetector, where a single new property
           would be just enough for now.

      -  | https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1255
         | SB: electron beam
         | PM: electron gun
         | HB: kathode-ray tube
         | BW: Electron Microscope should be just fine
         | AB: SB is in charge to call for a meeting of the EM community
           before the CC in June.

      -  | https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1248
         | Paulo: how can NXmx have SOURCE inside ENTRY if it NXentry
           does not allow if, but only INSTRUMENT which on the other
           hand does allow SOURCE
         | SB: base classes only define optional elements, but
           Application definitions can extend them
         | HB: structure shall not code information, but rather any
           information shall be on the same level.
         | AB: actually soft-linking solves this problem. The same
           information can be referenced by both ENTRY/SOURCE and
           ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/SOURCE.
