      -  NOBUGS is going to be postponed until next year (probably May)
      -  Will need to do the meeting remotely if we stick to the October
         dates.
      -  Will probably need to run it more like a teleconference with a
         series of teleconferences to organise the topics and then break
         up into interest groups.
      -  Need to have some discussion on the mailing list to make sure
         everyone is well informed.
      -  Could still follow the NOBUGS meeting, maybe even doing both an
         October virtual meeting and a 2021 meeting with NOBUGS.
      -  MK to check the previous NIAC minutes to clarify email voting
         procedures.

      -  AK has a pull request to be examined:

      -  Jungfrau dataset format is now fully NeXus compliant. passes
         cnxvalidate with no errors.

      -  Soon the AGIP detector for EuXFEL will also be fully compliant.

      -  PJ has created a `milestone
         NXDL2020.10 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/9>`__
         for all issues to be considered for next release of
         definitions.

      -  PJ poked BW about making further progress on the logo issue.
         Will set up a repository on dropbox for people to contribute

      -  Next meeting to aim for last week of June. BW will send out a
         doodle poll in advance to decide the exact date.
