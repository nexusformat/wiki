      Initial problems with hangout not allowing people to join the
      first two participants under the old URL. New Hangout created.

      Discussion on CMake: All look well now, except for the Windows
      build. That could be solved by using the cmake inbuilt make. Eugen
      has updated the ticket. In general small fixes can be done in
      master, larger possibly disruptive chunks of work should be merged
      by an independent person using a github pull request. This should
      be documented somewhere.

      NXmx: Discussion on allowing beam_center in units of pixels,
      instead of official units of length. No real agreement why that
      would be necessary, but also not a strong opposition. shutterless
      scans: One start and either end or interval value would be
      required. Not more. Encoding could be done via naming, or
      attributes. No consensus for now. A proposal will be developed.

      Moved remaining other items to next meeting.
