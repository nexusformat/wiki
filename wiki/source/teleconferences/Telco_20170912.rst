      There were some problems joining the telco. Aaron had to approve
      the participants. Hope that doesn't happen next time.

      One merged. NXdetector documentation deferred to the code camp.
      NXevent_data also lacks the scaling; pull request will be revised.

      Reflections: No update. We'll wait for feedback from LCLS.

      We did discuss the different use cases of multiple samples. Either
      as result of processing or of the fact that the experimental setup
      doesn't allow the data to be split between different samples, due
      to unknown shape or timing. Aaron put a pull request out with an
      example for processed data. Could be discussed at the code camp.
