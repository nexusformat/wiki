<h3>Interfaces, Features, Application Definitions, Example Data<a class="headerlink" href="#interfaces-features-application-definitions-example-data" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Clarification of what Interfaces and Features are. The Interfaces are a better way to organize base classes, Features are more fine grained application definitions and are set to replace them.</p>
<p>In this first round we did not come to a conclusion. The issues at stake where unclear to most attendees. We decided to defer  this discussions to after lunch. By then presentations on both topics will be presented by Mark Koennecke and Mark Basham.</p>

<h3><A name="decision_diffractometer"></A>NXdiffractometer, NXgoniometer<a class="headerlink" href="#nxdiffractometer-nxgoniometer" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is about having a special group in NXinstrument which describes a diffractometer. There is a lot of overlap with the content of NXtransformation.</p>
<p>We voted on: we add a group to NXinstrument named diffractometer which is of type NXtransformation. Voting result: All YES, no NO, no abstain.</p>

<p>We reopened NXdiffractometer because some attendees did not understand what they voted for.</p>
<p>For vote: a group of no specified name in NXinstrument
of type NXtransformation which describes a diffractometer. Result: 7 for, 4 abstain</p>
</section>
<section id="uncertainties">
<h3>Uncertainties<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainties" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Uncertainties is the name the NIAC agreed upon for discussing the storage of experimental or statistical errors associated with a dataset in a NeXus file.</p>
<p>This is more a discussion about a clarification of what the actual way of describing uncertainties is. There was a proposal to annotate uncertainties in 2014 but we did not arrive at a conclusion.</p>
<p>Pete Jemian will research this topic and bring up a proposal in the afternoon.</p>
</section>
<section id="nxdata-nxdetector">
<h3>NXdata, NXdetector<a class="headerlink" href="#nxdata-nxdetector" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In NXdata NeXus collects data to be plotted. In order to do perform more thorough data processing it is useful to link back from NXdata to the NXdetector group which describes the detector and data more fully. Up to now, NeXus uses the target attribute on the dataset for this function.</p>
<p>Mark Basham pointed out that the target attribute pointing to the original data in NXdetector  from NXdata is broken when the data pointed to is an linked external file. We may not even have the right to open the external file and add the target attribute to the dataset.</p>
<p>Proposal from Mark B: The attribute DATASETNAME_target can be used in the same way as the attribute target to a dataset is used but it is attached to the parent group.</p>
<p>Extending the target to annotate the target pointing to an external file does not work because the attribute may be attached to a dataset in an external file which we do not have control over.</p>
<p>There is a general problem relating data in different files with each other.</p>
<p>Armando suggests to have a DATASETNAME_target field which is a soft link to the group containing the dataset.</p>
<p>No conclusion was reached. We closed by defining an
action item as follows: Armando and Mark Basham work out together how to do this in a proper way. Both taking into account NeXus ways of doing things and the technical possibilities of HDF5. They come back at a later stage with a documented proposal with examples.</p>
</section>
<section id="nxptycho">
<h3><A name="decision_NXcxi_ptycho"></A>NXptycho<a class="headerlink" href="#nxptycho" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is coming from the CXI community who actual took NeXus, liked it but decided that reading and writing attributes is impossible. Mark Basham put the attributes back again. The resulting files are compatible with both CXI and NeXus.</p>
<p>A prerequisite for this application definition is an additional filed in the NXbeam base class which describes the extent of the beam. This change was proposed and voted for with:</p>
<p>For 7, 3 abstain, 0 against</p>
<p>NXptycho renamed to NXcxi and accepted. This is basically an application definition coming from an interested community.</p>
<p>Results of the vote: All in favor.</p>

<p>Mark Basham pointed out that CXI describes more methods then ptychography. Thus we need to be more specific  with the name of the application definition.</p>
<p>The proposal then is to rename NXcxi to  NXcxi_ptycho. Result: All in favor</p>
</section>
<section id="hdf5xmp">
<h3>HDF5XMP<a class="headerlink" href="#hdf5xmp" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The NIAC agreed in an earlier meeting that it would be nice if file managers could show a sensible thumbnail when encountering NeXus files. A suitable approach to achieve this was implemented by Ben Watts with the help of some funds from PSI.</p>
<p>Ben Watts informed the NISC about what has been done. It is possible to have a user block in a HDF5 file, before the actual HDF5 content starts. The approach is to place meta data and thumbnails in there.  There will be our own magic string which describes the content of our meta data in XMP format. This is a few keywords and a thumbnail. There are already plugins for most major file browsers on different OS which can work with this extra information. These plugins will be fed upstream into OS distributions.  There is python code to add thumbnails  and XMP data to the HDF5 file. Sidecar files with the xmp extension are also supported. The size of that user block has to be defined when opening the file.</p>
<p>The NIAC thanks Ben Watts and PSI for implementing this.</p>

<section id="uncertainties-continuation">
<h3><A name="decision__errors"></A>Uncertainties, continuation<a class="headerlink" href="#uncertainties-continuation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pete Jemian demonstrates his proposal. He proposes an uncertainties attribute to a dataset which as a value holds the name of another dataset containing the uncertainties. With the same shape as the original dataset.</p>
<p>Comment by Mark Basham: this does not work for linked datasets as you cannot add the attribute to the dataset in the external file. DATASETNAME_errors will work because in itself it can be a link.</p>
<p>Proposals:</p>
<p>Ben: uncertainties go into a dataset called DATASETNAME_error. We remove the error and uncertainties field from NXdata.</p>
<p>Armando: DATASETNAME_errors to be used as a general pattern when an error field is required.</p>
<p>Armando’s proposal accepted with all YES</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">errors</span></code> field and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">uncertainties</span></code> attribute in NXdata to be marked deprecated, 8 YES</p>
</section>
<section id="attribute-mask-and-normalisation">
<h3>Attribute Mask and Normalisation<a class="headerlink" href="#attribute-mask-and-normalisation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>We started the discussion by clarifying that NXdata is not only for plotting. It is used as a container for a data object. Especially in processed data.  It was noted that NXprocess is intended for processed data.</p>
<p><A name="decision__mask"></A>At times, there are invalid pixels in an array holding data from a detector. A means is needed to identify such pixels. This is commonly done with a mask field.</p>
<p>Proposal: DATASETNAME_mask as a general way to specify a mask. We use the conventions as described for NXdetector/pixel_mask with the option to use less that 32 bit.</p>
<p>1 against, all others(10) YES</p>
<p><A name="decision__weights"></A>It occurs that there is a need to divide a dataset with another one to normalize it.</p>
<p>Ray’s proposal: DATASETNAME_weights anywhere in a NeXus file. If it exists and has the same shape as the dataset, you are supposed to divide the data by the weights.</p>
<p>9 for, abstain 1,</p>
<p>Armando proposal: weights as an attribute to NXdata which denotes a dataset which the signal dataset has to be divided by.   This dataset can have one value or as many values as items of the signal to be normalized. The signal can specify its type by the interpretation attribute.</p>
<p>1 in favor, 5 against, rest abstain, NOT accepted</p>

<h3>Branding<a class="headerlink" href="#branding" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some NIAC members felt that the NeXus logo looks outdated.
Stuart Cambell suggested to drop the NeXus graphics to the BNL design team for reevaluation.  They will create a set of suggestions which the NIAC  will discuss at a later stage.</p>

<section id="messy-specifications">
<h3><A name="decision_string"></A>Messy Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#messy-specifications" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Over time, strings have become  a messy affair in NeXus:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We started with arrays of bytes. Which later became NX_CHAR.</p></li>
<li><p>HDF5 introduced variable length strings. Unfortunately, the popular h5py API for writing HDF5 files stores strings per default as such variable length strings. NeXus decided to support this, though the HDF-5 API for reading/writing such strings is of low quality</p></li>
<li><p>After some pressure from the community, arrays of strings were introduced. Now there is a choice to store a string as  a string or as an array of strings of length 1.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>After some discussion we arrived at the following proposal:</p>
<p>Array of strings are not allowed in situations where a single string is expected. Cnxvalidate should flag that. Result of the vote: All YES</p>

<h3><A name="decision_voting"></A>Voting<a class="headerlink" href="#voting" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>The NIAC constitution forces NIAC votes to be done by email. It is unclear however what the acceptance criteria for such email voting is. It happened often that not enough NIAC members actually voted. Moreover, there is a danger that the email vote is badly understood and the NIAC ends up with bad decisions. On the other hand, the NIAC meets only every two years. A means to vote on issues when there is a dire need is good to have. For the discussion resulted the following proposal:</p>
<p>Email voting as used up to 2018 only for membership renewals</p>
<p>For issues other then membership renewals the following rule applies: we vote by teleconference where the proposal can be discussed. At least 2/3 of the NIAC have to be present at the teleconference. Then normal majority vote of the attendees applies. Teleconference decisions need to be published on the NIAC mailing list. NIAC Members not attending the teleconference have a one week period in which they can add their vote to the tally. Those not responding in that week are counted as abstained.</p>

<h3>NeXus as Logbook<a class="headerlink" href="#nexus-as-logbook" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Presentation by Mark Koennecke about how to store logbook information in a NeXus file. The added value is that a suitable tool can interact with the logbook data.</p>
<p>Results of some discussion: Nice idea, but not in the NeXus  scope.  Nothing is stopping us to use NeXus in this way, however. No new features in NeXus are required.</p>

<p>Presentation about using interfaces for structuring the base classes better by Mark Koennecke.</p>
<p>Result: We bury the idea. It adds more complexity to NeXus then it is worth.  We look at the github branch for interfaces for ideas on structuring  the documentation of the base classes better. We add some documentation on inheritance and interfaces into the design section of the manual to the tune: we thought about it and stepped back from it because of the additional complexity introduced by this.</p>

<p>Clarification: Application definitions stay.</p>
<p>Features provide an example of reading and writing files and also do some validation.</p>
<p>Proposal:</p>

<h3>NeXus at Accelerators<a class="headerlink" href="#nexus-at-accelerators" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Feedback from the controls groups at PSI about storing data from accelerators in NeXus:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>They like NeXus</p></li>
<li><p>They  stumbled over the NXsample because they do not have a sample. And NXsample defines the origin of the NeXus coordinate system.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The situation is that they are using NeXus look alike things to describe an accelerator. They share some with other facilities.
NeXus is not built for accelerators, thus there is a case for a new tree of groups including one which describes the origin. The suggestion is to continue working on this and when they are ready to standardize, to come back to the NIAC.</p>
