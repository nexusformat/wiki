      .. rubric:: Report from HDF5 Workshop
         :name: report-from-hdf5-workshop

      -  C++ HDF5 API presented by EW
      -  Filters - HDF Group optentially has plans to sell them for
         writing, reading will be free. Do we want to compete with our
         repo
      -  HDF Group still aims to be more open source - opening their bug
         tracker and linking to a git repo from their web pages

      .. rubric:: Github Issues
         :name: Telco_20171107_github-issues

      Two old ones have been looked at now: NXlog has the time dataset
      changed from NX_INT to NX_NUMBER (was probably TSR's editing error
      in the first place). And we decided some English language is
      required near the 'data' dataset in Nxdetector to ensure people
      don't think 4 dimensions are mandatory.

      Two tickets have been generated by Ray and require further input
      from him. Mark B produces more example files for him to digest and
      will send link to Dawn source code that deal with axes for
      plotting. Validation shall already check for dimensions for
      \_indices etc in NXdata. Maybe a feature to extract the
      information would help.
