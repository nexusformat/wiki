      Pull requests accepted and closed.

      Ticket opened for clarifying status of    anonymous    groups (without
      a specific required name) in the documentation. That is currently
      rendered as    (name)    without the qoutes, which is not obvious.

      Examples for uncertainties: Well received, except for the units
      1/A for 1/Angstroms, which will require further discussions. We
      will need to update the documentation and NXDL to formally allow
      uncertainties.

      AOB: Ray suggests we are present at the RDA meeting and
      remote-data-pre-meeting in Barcelona in April. He will provide
      links via mail.    LInks to RDA    set on the agenda for next time.
