      Present:

      Eugen (only listening), Herbert, Andreas from Dectris, Pete
      Jemian, Mark K.

      -  Andreas brought up some question regrading trigger_delay_time
         which resolved into a clarification that the one in NeXus base
         class is the hardware trigger_delay_time. A new,
         effective_trigger_delay, time in proposed which will sum all
         trigger delays, from hardware or software or else.
      -  As the main players for the other topics on the Agenda were not
         present, we discussed the NXvalidate white paper. Many points
         were resolved. Mark K will update the white paper with the
         results of the discussions shortly. It was felt that it is more
         important to get the things done rather then haggle for a long
         time about the optimal solution and details.
      -  The discussion returned to NXmx. Uptake of NeXus/HDF-5 is still
         difficult. The problem are the data analysis package
         maintainers. Herbert suggested to have a workshop and help them
         get NeXus implemented around one of the big crystallographic
         conferences next year. Dectris may be supporting this workshop.
