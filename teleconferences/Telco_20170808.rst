      Present: HJB, TSR, MK

      .. rubric:: PDB
         :name: Telco_20170808_pdb

      HJB created a branch. Because the PDB information is encoded in
      CIF the NeXus base class was named NXcif. The request was raised
      to rename it to NXpdb to avoid unnecessary confusion. This was
      completed during the conference call.

      .. rubric:: Dark Field
         :name: dark-field

      EW requested a dataset for storing dark frames. In extension to
      how ``NXmx`` has ``flatfield`` the suggestion would be to define
      ``darkfield``. Since it is important and can be different to the
      main data acquisition HJB suggested also to define
      ``darkfield_exposure_time``.

      .. rubric:: Code Camp
         :name: Telco_20170808_code-camp

      The invite has gone out (to -committee for now). Should be more
      widely distributed. Staying in the onsite accommodation wasn"t
      recommended. We"ll get in contact with MB.

      .. rubric:: Github Issue of the Day
         :name: Telco_20170808_github-issue-of-the-day

      The only issue marked "telco" was already discussed last time.
      Removed the label.

      .. rubric:: Next Meeting
         :name: Telco_20170808_next-meeting

      That was it. Short meeting.
