     proposal which has already been reviewed. As it has been voted and

   | AB: SB could open a new issue on updating the original and

   | AB: We could make NXcomponent a superclass of lots of instrument
     components. This can be addressed in a separate PR.
   | HB: NXcomponent properties could be part of NXobject
   | AB: Alternative: keep NXlens_em separate from NXcomponent if it
     shall be merged before making a decision on NXcomponent.
