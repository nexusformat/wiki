      Since the `NOBUGS 2020 conference <https://tiny.cc/nobugs2020>`__
      has been postponed and continuing COVID-19 issues, the 2020 NIAC
      will be held as a series of teleconferences on Monday 12th and
      Tuesday 13th October (just prior to the orginal NOBUGS2020 dates).
      A `NeXus code
      camp <../codecamps/CodeCamp2020-2.html>`__ will
      also be held as an online event on Monday 19th and Tuesday 20th
      October, the week after NIAC 2020. A final short NIAC session is
      planned for October 20th in order to deal with new issues
      discovered during the code camp. Precise details will be discussed
      at the `NeXus teleconferences <../teleconferences/teleconferences.html>`__
      and published here before October 1st.

      Voting on changes to the NeXus standard is reserved for `committee
      members <../niac/niac.html>`__, but any
      interested parties are welcome to observe and stimulate
      discussions. Topics for the NIAC meeting should be registered as
      `issues <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues>`__ in the
      `NIAC <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC>`__ repository on
      GitHub.

      Registration for the NIAC and code camp is probably not going to
      be required, but we might set up some way to indicate intended
      attendence in order to improve organisation.
