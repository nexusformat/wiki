      The NIAC2022 meeting will be held as a hybrid event hosted by the
      `Paul Scherrer Institute <https://www.psi.ch>`__ on September
      14-16th, which is the week before the `2022 NOBUGS
      conference <https://indico.psi.ch/event/12738/>`__.

      As COVID19 continues to be a concern, people will be able to
      participate both onsite and online (via Zoom). In order to better
      overlap with other time zones (especially in the Americas), the
      meeting sessions will be shorter and later in the day (CEST) over
      3 days (instead of the usual 2 days).

      .. rubric:: Venue and Accommodation
         :name: NIAC2022_venue-and-accommodation

      PSI is a major research institute in `northern
      Switzerland <https://goo.gl/maps/pfBDWUdopjhdeWFQ6>`__ hosting a
      number of `large-scale
      facilities <https://www.psi.ch/de/science/large-research-facilities>`__
      and `specialised research
      laboratories <https://www.psi.ch/de/science/research-departments-and-labs>`__.
      It is easy to `reach by public
      transport <https://www.psi.ch/en/visit/how-to-find-us>`__. The
      `PSI Pocket web-app <https://pocket.psi.ch/home>`__ provides lots
      of useful information for visitors. Public transport in
      Switzerland is very good and reliable and thus is highly
      recommended. Trains, busses and ferries all share the same
      ticketing system so that a single ticket covers a journey that may
      utilise a combination of vehicles. While the tickets are typically
      based on zones being traversed, most ticket purchases are
      organised by simply stating the start and end points. Journeys can
      be streamlined by using the `SBB Mobile
      app <https://www.sbb.ch/en/timetable/mobile-apps/sbb-mobile.html>`__,
      which provides time tables, ticket purchasing and holds tickets
      (only have to show the ticket if asked by a train conductor).
      Trips can be `planned online <https://www.sbb.ch/en/>`__ with
      links to purchase tickets in advance to be downloaded to a phone
      or as PDF.

      The `PSI guest house <https://www.psi.ch/de/guesthouse>`__ is
      conveniently situated on site, and is probably the cheapest option
      but is considered basic by many. The PSI guest house also has
      limited availability and so should be booked as early as possible.
      Other `nearby
      hotels <https://www.psi.ch/de/guesthouse/nearby-hotels>`__ are a
      short bus ride away (such busses typically run every half hour).

      The
      `climate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich#Climate>`__ in
      mid-September is generally cool to mild with overcast, foggy
      mornings being common.

      `Registration
      Form <https://indico.psi.ch/event/13249/registrations/1773/>`__

      `One Page Overview <https://indico.psi.ch/event/13249/?print=1>`__

      We ask that all participants register for the meeting, regardless
      of whether they will be joining in person or online so that
      sufficient resources can be organised. People outside of the NIAC
      are invited to join discussions and register for the meeting but
      voting will be restricted to committee members only.

      .. rubric:: COVID19 Precautions
         :name: NIAC2022_covid19-precautions

      There are currently no coronavirus restrictions in place at
      `PSI <https://www.psi.ch/en/useroffice>`__ or by the `Swiss
      government <https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home/krankheiten/ausbrueche-epidemien-pandemien/aktuelle-ausbrueche-epidemien/novel-cov/empfehlungen-fuer-reisende.html>`__.
      However, the situation could change, especially as the weather
      gets cooler, and we encourage attendees to consider both their own
      safety and the safety of others with appropriate hygiene, testing
      and vaccination.

      .. rubric:: Agenda
         :name: NIAC2022_agenda

      The meeting agenda will be based on a `Github
      project <https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/2>`__ so
      that it is accessible to all particpants. Any proposal to be
      discussed and voted on should be documented as an issue in the
      `nexusformat/NIAC
      repository <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues>`__.

      .. rubric:: Schedule
         :name: NIAC2022_schedule

      The meeting will have sets of 2 hour sessions with 30 minute
      breaks. 3 sessions per day for 3 days.
