         :name: spring-virtual-niac-2022
         :class: page-title

      The 2022 Spring Virtual NIAC will be held on March 3rd and 4th,
      2022. It aims to provide some decisions and feedback requested by
      the community. Since it is not the "ordinary" biennial NIAC meeting
      (which will be `held in September <NIAC2022.html>`__), the
      `constitution <NIAC.html>`__ lays out stricter rules for making decisions:

      "Voting outside of the biennial NIAC meetings can take two forms.
      Firstly, memberships can be approved by email ballot. All other
      issues require a teleconference for interactive discussion that is
      attended by at least 2/3 of the NIAC. Votes may be cast at the
      teleconference, as well as during the following week in order to
      allow NIAC members not attending the teleconference to add their
      vote to the tally. The opening of the voting period must be
      advertised through the NIAC mailing list. At the close of the
      1-week voting period, NIAC members not responding are counted as
      abstained and the NIAC decision follows the voting category
      (usually "for" and "against") with the highest number of valid
      votes."

      .. rubric:: Agenda and Sessions
         :name: NIAC2022_spring_agenda-and-sessions

      Each agenda item should be an issue in the `NIAC
      repository <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues>`__ (which
      should refer/link to issues in other repositories where
      appropriate) and organised via a `github
      project <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/projects/4>`__.

      The meeting will consist of 4 sessions over the 3rd and 4th of
      March, plus a 5th session at least a week later:
