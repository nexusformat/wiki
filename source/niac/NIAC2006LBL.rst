      -  You are responsible for your own breakfast and travel to the
         lab. In theory there are many people staying at the DoubleTree
         and the Durant so carpooling is encouraged.
      -  Arrive at the badging office and they will give you a visitor
         badge and a "blue triangle" parking pass. For those of you
         without a car there is a lab shuttle bus that will take you
         from there to building two (2).
      -  We will be starting at 8:30 am (pacific time) in building two
         (2) room 100B. This is the biggest room and will be where
         refreshments are served.

         **data requirers**. Discuss if the NIAC constitution should be
         change to allow data requirers e.g. DANSE to have
         representation on the NIAC as a stakeholder that requires
         NeXus.

      .. rubric:: API/Technical Issues
         :name: apitechnical-issues

      -  Improving NeXus internal code documention on private structures
         and functions. Only API developer needs to know about these,
         but at the moment the knowledge is restricted to a few people.
         The existing in-code documentation needs to be tidied up and it
         would be a good idea if programs such as
         `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html>`__
         could parse it.
      -  Move from the current `CVS <http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/>`__ (for
         version control) / `Bugzilla <http://www.bugzilla.org/>`__ (for
         bugs/issues) system to using
         `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`__ /
         `TRAC <http://trac.edgewall.org/>`__. Freddie has set up two
         sites at
         ` <http://svn.nexusformat.org/code>`__\ http://svn.nexusformat.org/code
         and
         ` <http://trac.nexusformat.org>`__\ http://trac.nexusformat.org
         for testing
      -  Move mailing list to nexusformat.org
      -  Determine location to store definitions
      -  Design and implement a way to deal with having approved
         definitions and a way to modify a working copy on the website
      -  It would be useful if NeXus could support arrays of strings
      -  Source and target of a link must have same name
      -  Java package name should be org.nexusformat
