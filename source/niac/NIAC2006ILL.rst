      The format of the last meeting at Santa Fe was very productive,
      and so similar break-out group meeting rooms are envisaged at this
      meeting. Such groups might be

      -  this group will meet separately on the second and third days,
         and may be expected to offer objective feedback and criticism
         on the NeXus project from their fresh point of view.

      It will be possible, too, to find additional space if other
      specific interest groups wish to meet separately.

      We should designate a publication sub-committee to write a report
      for Synchrotron Radiation News and Neutron News

      The problem of regular finance of NIAC activities has been posed
      to the ILL directors, and one is invited to the opening of the
      meeting.
