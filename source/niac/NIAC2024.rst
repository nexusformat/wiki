      Note there are two registration forms, for onsite and remote
      attendance.

      -  Those onsite need to register for the NIAC satellite meeting
         (100 EUR registration fee), but do not need to register for
         NOBUGS if they are only coming for NIAC. Please see the
         "Registration form for in person satellite meetings (ONLY)".
      -  Remote attendees should use the "Registration form for remote
         participants".
      -  Remote attendees who do not participate in NOBUGS do NOT need
         to register. A Zoom meeting ID will be shared in due time.

      People outside of the NIAC are invited to join discussions and
      register for the meeting but voting will be restricted to
      committee members only.

      .. rubric:: COVID19 Precautions
         :name: NIAC2024_covid19-precautions

      There are currently no coronavirus restrictions in place at ESRF
      or the French government. However, the situation could change,
      especially as the weather gets cooler, and we encourage attendees
      to consider both their own safety and the safety of others with
      appropriate hygiene, testing and vaccination.

      .. rubric:: Agenda
         :name: NIAC2024_agenda

      The meeting agenda will be based on a `Github
      project <https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/5/>`__ so
      that it is accessible to all particpants. Any proposal to be
      discussed and voted on should be documented as an issue in the
      `nexusformat/NIAC
      repository <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues>`__.

      The main task of the meeting is to ratify `contributed
      definitions <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/contributed_definitions/index.html#contributed-definitions>`__
      that are ready into the main NeXus repository of `application
      definitions and base
      classes <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/index.html>`__.
      Initial work by a NIAC organizing committee has split the work
      into two projects, depending on the whether the contribution arose
      from the `FAIRMAT
      project <https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/index.html>`__:

      -  `Review of non-FAIRMAT Contributed
         Definitions <https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/4/>`__.
      -  Review of FAIRMAT Contributed Definitions (link will be
         provided when ready).
