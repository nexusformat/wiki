-  Discussion items

 -  time_focusing_type (e.g. difc, cubic, ..)
 -  time_focusing_parameters [ndetector,nparameters]
 -  Definition of groups for binning in NeXus file or via
    NXdetector ?
 -  Deadtime correction information (in combination with
    gang.)
 -  Profile types and starting parameters
 -  Incident spectrum (here in NXcharacterization, alternative
    analytical description ?)

-  Other
