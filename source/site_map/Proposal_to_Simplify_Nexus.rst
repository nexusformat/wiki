This document presents conclusions and proposals from the NeXus ILL/ESRF Local Advisory Committee (NLAC).

NeXus *raison d'Ãªtre*
=====================

- NeXus is an exchange format for all neutron, X-ray, and muon scattering techniques in large facilities.

- This implicitly limits the scope of NeXus to all that is common to these techniques, while excluding instrument/technique peculiarities. Further descriptions (instrument details) are in principle out of scope, but may be specified as extensions to the basic requirements.

- The scientific data set is intrinsically the most important to physicists, compared with the exact instrument definition (which is essentially relevant for instrument debugging and simulation purposes). The official 'base' NeXus format should focus on the former rather than the latter.

- NeXus must be easy to use.

  - This means that there is an efficient API (and this is the case, thanks to Mark K.)

  - At the same time, NeXus should be flexible enough to potentially evolve from HDF and XML towards other physical storage formats (Open Document, ...)

- NeXus must be appealing for people to voluntarily use it (in programs).

  - This means that the format structure must be clear, simple, and easy to understand. This is probably the most important point, otherwise it will push people to develop their own NeXus format, or even use their own non-NeXus format (based on HDF or not).

- The NeXus web server must present usage examples and distribute associated software.

- NeXus must be flexible and expandable.

  - This means that there should be a recommended mechanism for extension of the 'base' NeXus into 'proprietary' NeXus. At the same time, a clear statement must be made concerning a limited number of absolute requirements, as well as 'official' recommendations for extensions.

- The scientific data must be immediately visible in the NeXus structure, as well as essential parameters for the data analysis. This means that the NXdata must be directly in the NXentry, and that essential parameters should be there as well (in an NXparameters class, see below). Further information (NXinstrument, ...) is optional.

Format requirements
-------------------

### Proposal R1: Simplified NeXus hierarchy

The base NeXus format should contain the following hierarchy:

- `NXentry`

- `NXdata`

- `NXsample`

- `NXparameters`

Other classes should be mentioned as optional, even though NXmonitor and NXuser are recommended.

### Proposal R2: simplified NXdata

- Rename `long_name` into `label` in variable

- Suppress `first_good` and `last_good`

- Add a `range` attribute to variable so that it can be given as a regularly sampled range.

### Proposal R3: scanning mechanism (dim <= 3)

For low dimensionality data sets (dim <= 3), the scan may be stored as an array in the NXdata, with associated axis.

### Proposal R4: scanning mechanism (general): NXgroup

As an alternative, or for higher dimensionality, each scan step is stored as a single NXdata, with one 'master' NXgroup describing how to assemble scan steps into series. The assembling mechanism is to be discussed further.

### Proposal R5: the NXparameters class

As an alternative to the NXinstrument, which usually brings too much information as required for a basic data analysis, a new NXparameters class should be defined next to the NXdata, and gather 'important' parameters to be used by scientists. The NXparameter is a kind of 'abstract' of NXinstrument. The list of these parameters should be defined per class of instrument, based on requirements from existing data analysis programs (FullProf, INX, Sqw, Dave, Isaw, Nathan, ...), to be discussed further.

Format extensions (optional)
----------------------------

### Proposal E1: NXinstrument is optional

The NXinstrument class is optional. No NXinstrument class should be specifically defined as 'official'. However, some examples per class of instrument will be available to programmers. Indeed, as all instruments are essentially unique, no description can cope with all of them. The usage of NXinstrument usually concerns instrument simulations (McStas, Vitess, NISP, ResTrax, IDEAS, ...) as well as exact configuration (e.g., for repeating experiments and debugging purposes).

### Proposal E2: NXinstrument vs NXdata and redundancy

If present, NXinstrument should contain all the relevant information concerning the instrument parameters. In order to prevent redundancy for the data set (in detector and NXdata), the usage of links is required. An NXsample class should better appear in the NXinstrument as a link to the NXentry/NXsample. One or more NXmonitor classes should better appear in the NXinstrument as a link to the NXentry/NXmonitor.

### Proposal E3: positioning and distances

The 'official' mechanism for distance/geometry specification is NXgeometry. It derives from the McStas positioning system. Other distance specification attributes defined within NXinstrument objects should be avoided.

### Proposal E4: no object definition

The usage of objects and inheritance is not envisaged as it brings too much complexity in the associated definitions. We rather promote a simplification of the existing NeXus.

### Proposal E5: grouping of equivalent elements

The NXgroup class could be used to assemble other items than scan steps in order to define super-classes, e.g., sets of detectors and monochromators.
