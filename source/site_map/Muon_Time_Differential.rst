Muon Time Differential
======================


The Instrument Definition for the Muon instruments has
evolved from that proposed in 2001 to the more robust definition
outlined in the linked discussion document (pdfs/Muon_V2R7.pdf). For
completeness both are discussed in this document; however, the NIAC are
asked to vote on and ratify the 'Muon Instrument Definition: Version 2 -
pulsedTD' Aspects of the Muon Definition either introduce new NeXus
Classes or extend existing definitions. These are discussed separately
in the linked document (pdfs/Elements_for_Muons.pdf), and the NIAC are
asked to separately consider and ratify these elements that are key to
the Muon definition.
