NXmeasurement
=============

This is a proposal for NeXus which comes out of the NeXus for Synchrotrons workshop at PSI. In order to satisfy the
requirements of the beamline scientist, an additional, simplified NeXus hierarchy is proposed:

- entry: NXentry

- measurement: NXmeasurement

- positions: NXpositioners

- scalars: NXscalar

- images: NXimagedata

Please note that this is an example of how an NXmeasurement group may look like. The general feeling was to allow much
freedom in NXmeasurement and standardize later on if a common pattern emerges. The meaning is that the NXpositioners
group contains a list of all constants and motor positions, NXscalar arrays of all parameters varied during the scan,
and NXimageData contains the images and other detector data that have been captured during a scan or measurement.

This structure is for the expert, the instrument scientist, who knows his instrument by heart and wishes to be able to
plot anything against anything in his instrument. NXmeasurement is not meant to stand alone but is to be augmented with
further NXsubentries containing the data in proper NeXus notation and hierarchy. It was pointed out that such a
simplified view can be generated by a data analysis application from a full NeXus NXinstrument view.

Conclusion
----------

01/2015: As an in-part answer to this proposal, the NIAC adopted the NXcollection base class as a free-form container
for things which no one cares to standardize. Data in NXcollection will not be validated. But such a free-form structure
defeats one objective of NeXus, namely providing a dictionary of well-defined field names. Thus, users are encouraged
to use the base classes as far as possible and communicate with the NIAC about missing fields. NXmeasurement, as
suggested here, was rejected.
