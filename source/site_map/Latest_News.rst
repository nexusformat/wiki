The upcoming Code Camp will be hosted by Diamond Light
Source 24th to 26th October. Visit [Code Camp 2017] <Code_Camp_2017.html)
for more information and registration. February: The main NeXus webpage
migrated away from being a single static page and the wiki stopped being
driven by mediawiki. Both are now (again) hosted together as Github
Pages with pages being build out of markup files. In the (still ongoing)
process we aim to reduce the amount of outdated information offered.

**Wednesday, October 31,2007**:

The NeXus technical committee is pleased to announce the official
release of version 4.1 of the eXus API. The NeXus API provides a unified
interface for writing hierarchical data files in HDF4, HDF5, and XML
formats. Version 4.1 resolves a number of bugs reported in the 4.0
release including issues with python bindings, text strings in the XML
library, and problems encountered with using the Absoft FORTRAN90
compiler. Details of the new features contained in 4.1 can be found in
the [Release Notes] <http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/browser/tags/4.1.0/NEWS) Source
code, binary packages, and example code can be downloaded from `[download
page] <Download.html>`__.

**Tuesday, September 11, 2007**:
The upcoming 4.1 release of the NeXus API is now undergoing testing. More
details can be found on the [testing site] <NeXus_41_Testing.html
"wikilink") as well as [provisional release notes] <Nexus_41_Release_Notes.html>

**Friday, May 25, 2007**:

The NeXus technical committee is pleased to announce the official release of
version 4.0 of the NeXus API. The NeXus API provides a unified interface
for writing hierarchical data files in HDF4, HDF5, and XML formats.
Version 4.0 resolves a number of bugs reported in the 3.0 release by
providing updated makefiles, support for the gfortran compiler, and an
improved test suite. New functionality in the NeXus API includes support
for two dimensional character arrays, linking to data items in other
files (external linking) via the NXmakenamedlink() call, and print the
target to a link reference with via the NXprintlink() call. File format-
specific developments include extension of the XML API to handle
unlimited dimensions, support for group attributes in HDF4, and
support for reading generic (non-NeXus) HDF5 files. The new release also
automagically generates documentation from the source code using the
Doxygen documentation system. Details of the new features contained in
4.0.0 can be found in the [Release Notes] <http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/browser/tags/4.0.0/NEWS)

**Friday, March 16, 2007**:

The upcoming 4.0 release of the NeXus API is now
undergoing testing. More details can be found on the [testing
site] <NeXus_4_Testing.html> as well as [provisional release
notes] <Nexus_4_Release_Notes.html>

**Thursday, December 7, 2006**:

Site updated to MediaWiki 1.8.2

**Tuesday, November 28, 2006**:

A NeXus install kit for Microsoft Windows is [now
available] <http://download.nexusformat.org/kits/windows) The kit
includes the standard NeXus applications as well as libraries for
building applications with both [MinGW] <http://www.mingw.org/) and
Microsoft Visual Studio.

**Tuesday, November 21, 2006**:

The NeXus [MailingLists] <mailinglist.html> have been moved to a [new
server] <http://lists.nexusformat.org). Future postings should be made to
\*listname*@nexusformat.org rather than to \*listname*@anl.gov Tuesday,
September 26, 2006: The NeXus WIKI has been moved to new site at
[] <https://www.nexusformat.org/) and updated to MediaWiki 1.7.1 2005


**Monday, November 7, 2005**:

We are planning the next meeting of the
`[NeXus International Advisory Committee] <../niac/niac.html>`__. The
current proposal is to hold it in Grenoble in the first week of
February, but details will be announced as they are finalized. In the
meantime, check the `[NeXus Wiki pages] <../niac/NIAC2006ILL.html>`__ for
discussions of the agenda.

**Friday, July 15, 2005**:

The technical committee is pleased to announce the official release of [version 3.0.0 of the
NeXus API] <http://www.nexus.anl.gov/nexus_api.html#download). Mark
Koennecke has incorporated infrastructure permitting the use of XML as
an additional data format in the same way that it is already possible to
switch between HDF4 and HDF5. The same API calls will be used for all
underlying formats so that their use will be transparent to the calling
program. The distribution now includes [Peter Peterson's] <User%3APfpeterson.html>
`[NXtranslate] <NXtranslate.html>`__ utility to map data in
existing files to NeXus format via XML translation files. This
application will aid developers to write NeXus reading applications by
converting real data in a facility-native format to the NeXus standard.
In addition a [bugzilla server] <http://nexus.isis.rl.ac.uk/) has been
established as a clearinghouse for bug reports and feature requests.

**Thursday, June 23, 2005**:

The NeXus wiki is born. It uses the MediaWiki
software that powers [Wikipedia] <http://www.wikipedia.org/) and is much
more flexible than the [Swiki] <http://www.neutron.anl.gov:8080/NeXus) we
have been using until now.

**Thursday, March 17, 2005**:

The next meeting of the NeXus International Advisory Committee (NIAC) will be held April
26-28 at the [Bishop's Lodge] <http://www.bishopslodge.com/) in Sante Fe,
NM. The main task during these three days is to create instrument
definitions.

2004
----

**Monday, November 1, 2004**:

The minutes of the second meeting of the NeXus International Advisory Committee (October
21-22, 2004) are now available.

**Wednesday, October 13, 2004**:

The draft agenda of the upcoming NIAC meeting is now on the NeXus Swiki - we
invite comments up to the day of the meeting.

**Saturday, October 9, 2004**:

The new version of the web site has just been installed. The most
significant new feature, apart from the change in design is that the
recently voted NeXus classes are now displayed in a simplified table
format, that we hope is easier to read. This is generated automatically
from the XML file so will reflect the latest version at all times. There
is still a little cleaning up of the documentation of these classes,
with the final CVS uploads occurring at the upcoming meeting of the
`[NeXus International Advisory Committee] <../niac/niac.html>`__. If you
find any errors, please contact the chair (Ray Osborn) or executive
secretary (Peter Peterson) of NIAC.

**Thursday, August 31, 2004**:

NXvalid allows a user to look at the contents of a NeXus file, like a graphical
version of NXbrowse. The latest version is the first to incorporate the
ISAW viewers for plotting 1D and 2D NXdata and NXmonitor. ISAW is a
separate application developed at IPNS and needs to be separately
installed. If ISAW is not installed, NXvalid will still work, but the
viewers will not be available.

**Friday, June 4, 2004**:

The second meeting of the NeXus International Advisory Committee will be held at the Paul
Scherrer Institut, near Villigen, Switzerland, on October 21-22, 2004,
immediately following NOBUGS 2004. See the NeXus Swiki page for more
details.

**Thursday, April 15, 2004**:

NXdir is a console based tool that
allows inspecting the contents of a NeXus file. It allows for directory
like listing of contents as well as printing out data. Version 0.2.4,
which allows the user to select a 1D or 2D NXdata to write out to a
file, has just been released.

2003
----

**Friday, September 24, 2003**:

The minutes of the first meeting of the NeXus International Advisory
Committee are now available.

**Friday, July 25, 2003**:

The first meeting of the NeXus International Advisory Committee will be held at the
California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, USA, from
1:30pm September 8 to 12:30pm, September 10, 2003. See the NIAC 2003 web
page for more details.

2002
----

**Saturday, December 14, 2002**:

Another proposal made at the NOBUGS conference was that we set up an interactive
web forum to allow anyone to suggest changes to the NeXus format. We
have now set up the NeXus Swiki for this purpose. This is an
implementation of a Wiki Wiki Web which allows visitors to edit the web
pages directly in their browser. We welcome any constructive
contributions, and just ask that you respect the guidelines that are
referenced on the Swiki home page.

**Monday, December 2, 2002**:

Following a meeting of NeXus users and developers at the recent NOBUGS conference,
we have decided to set up the NeXus Advisory Committee to oversee future
developments of the format. The proposed Terms of Reference are given
here. The membership of the committee will be nominated by neutron,
x-ray, and muon facilities, and announced in the next few weeks.

**Saturday, September 14, 2002**:

This is the official release of version 2.0.0 of the NeXus API. Mark Koennecke and Uwe Filges have produced a
version that will read and/or write both HDF4 and HDF5 files. This is
transparent to the user (except when he/she is choosing to write either
an HDF4 or HDF5 file), i.e., the API calls are identical for both sets
of files. Being able to migrate from one underlying format to another is
one of the reasons why we developed a separate API, so it is good to see
that it works in practice. Also included in this release are two new
utilities, NXtoXML and NXtoDTD, which convert existing NeXus files to
XML, with and without data values respectively. NXtoDTD can be used to
produce the skeleton of a NeXus metaDTD file from an existing NeXus
file.

**Monday, July 8, 2002**:

We have created a new XML meta-DTD format for
specifying the contents of NeXus files. These files are well-conformed
DTD-less XML files, which therefore allow us to use standard XML forms
to edit or display them. The aim is to make the instrument and other
formats much more formally defined.

2000
----

**Thursday, December 14, 2000**:

The first public workshop devoted to the NeXus format will occur
from March 20-21, 2001, at PSI, near Zurich, Switzerland. Check the
NeXus'2001 web page for further details.

**Wednesday, December 6, 2000**:

Version 1.3.3 of the API has been released. It includes a new
routine, NXflush, to flush data to the output file, and the new Java API
as part of the standard distribution.

**Friday, October 20, 2000**:

Mark Koennecke has released the initial version of NeXus API in the Java
programming language. It uses the Java Native Methods Interface in order
to access the C language NAPI calls, so it can only be used by Java
applications, not by applets. A shared library is needed in order to run
a NeXus for Java program.

**Tuesday, September 5, 2000**:
The NeXus FTP site has been moved to a (hopefully permanent) location at <>. The API
installation section has been updated accordingly.

**Tuesday, June 20, 2000**:

At the recent NOBUGS III conference, several members of the NeXus
design team made presentations of their work on NeXus. Mark Koennecke
described a java web-based data server and browser, Przemek Klosowski
discussed efforts at NIST to build a Tcl/Tk-based data explorer, and
Chris Moreton-Smith presented a proposal to formalize the NeXus format
in XML. NeXus was also discussed in a data formats subgroup. Watch these
pages for further developments.

**Thursday, March 9, 2000**:

Version 1.3.2 has now been released. It contains some enhancements to the
functionality of the NeXus terminal browser, NXbrowse, including the
ability to specify the file name in the command line and to dump data
into an ASCII file. It also fixes potential problems when compiling on
systems which do not use 4-byte int's and simplifies the interface
between Fortran and C on Windows systems. See the release notes for more
details.

**Monday, January 24, 2000**:

The latest version of the NeXus terminal browser, NXbrowse, is now written in ISO C (NXbrowse.c), and
can be installed from the NAPI Makefile (i.e. make NXbrowse). See the
section on NeXus browsers for more details. Four extra routines have
been added to the C and F77 core API's. They are NXgetgroupinfo,
NXinitgroupdir, NXgetattrinfo, and NXinitattrdir. NXinitgroupdir and
NXinitattrdir allow the reinitialization of group and attribute searches
using NXgetnextentry and NXgetnextattr respectively. The NeXus API
version number is now 1.3.1.

1999
----

**Tuesday, December 14, 1999**:

Following popular demand, Mark Koennecke has updated the NeXus API
to include data compression. In the core API, compression is invoked by
a call to NXcompress between calls to NXopendata and NXputdata. N.B.
Mark Koennecke pointed out that earlier claims that NXcompress could be
used with NXputslab are incorrect; if data are to be compressed, they
must be written in one go using NXputdata. It may be possible to relax
this constraint when appending data along an unlimited dimension. We
will let you know when that's possible. The C, F77 and F90 API's have
been updated. Data is automatically compressed in NXUwritedata
(currently only a part of the F90 Utility API) if there has been a call
to NXUsetcompress, which defines the compression algorithm and the
minimum size of data set to be compressed (it makes no sense to compress
very small arrays). The current version of the NeXus API is v1.3.0.

**Wednesday, November 24, 1999**:

There was yet another small error in the
Fortran 90 example program. The call to NXUwriteglobals did not have the
correct syntax. This has prompted a change to NXUwriteglobals to make
all the arguments optional, allowing the use of the F90 keyword syntax
when only a few attributes are to be written.

**Monday, November 22, 1999**:

The latest version of the ILL's popular data analysis package LAMP
is able to read and write NeXus files. Although it normally requires an
IDL license, they are also distributing a run-time version for various
operating systems.

**Friday, November 5, 1999**:

The NeXus API has been re-released as version 1.2.1 under the terms of the GNU Lesser General
Public License. While this maintains the freedom of use of the NeXus API
available under the GNU General Public License, it allows commercial
developers to incorporate the code into any software that is
subsequently sold for profit. We feel that this should be beneficial to
the NeXus community in the long run. If you have any comments on this
decision, please send them to the NeXus mailing list.

**Monday, October 18, 1999**:

A new version of the NeXus API has been released. It is now
version 1.2.0. Check the release notes for information concerning the
changes, which mostly involve minor bug fixes.

**Monday, September 20, 1999**:

The NeXus Home Page has been redesigned to make it easier to find
individual web pages. If it does not format well in your browser, please
let me know.

**Friday, September 10, 1999**:

A small (but significant) error
has been corrected in the Fortran 90 example program. The file\\_id
variable should be declared as the derived type NXhandle, i.e.
type(NXhandle) :: file_id and not as a character string. Apologies if
that caused any confusion. Separate HTML files dedicated to the three
language interfaces, C, F77 and F90 have been added, along with improved
navigation aids within them. Thursday, August 19, 1999:The first version
of the Fortran 90 API has been installed on the FTP server and updated
the API file accordingly. It includes both an F90 version of the core
API and a utility API to simplify some of the NeXus file navigation. If
they prove useful, we will see if they can be implemented in C and/or
F77. A simple terminal browser for a NeXus file, NXbrowse.f90, has been
written. After compiling, linking, and running, type HELP at the
terminal for a list of available commands (upper or lower case).

**Thursday, August 12, 1999**:

Freddie Akeroyd has set up an archive of the
NeXus mailing list. The latest version of the NeXus API, which contains
changes to the way NeXus groups are linked, has been installed. The
previous method was not 100% reliable. Some of the links to Fortner
Software have been updated at their request.

**Saturday, June 5, 1999**:

Some extra definitions to the NeXus glossary have been added e.g. definitions
of NXdetector, NXcollimator, and NXattenuator. These are based on
suggestions by Ron Ghosh and Chris Moreton-Smith a while ago, but I
never got around to putting them on the web. Please view these
definitions critically when you have need to use them. Friday, April 2,
1999:A site map has been added so that it is easier to find some of the
lower-lying web pages.

1998
----

**Wednesday, November 25, 1998**:

An explicit set of instructions for identifying plottable data has been
added, since this is an important aim of the NeXus format. This issue
came up in the NeXus mailing list a while ago, but I never added it to
the web pages. The instructions reported here will, at some stage, be
incorporated into a higher-level suite of API routines.

**Friday, November 20, 1998**:

The first release of HDF5 v 1.0.0 is now available. Only Unix
platforms are currently supported, so we will not change the NeXus API
just yet. However, preliminary views of the revised HDF API suggest that
we can layer the NeXus API transparently on top of HDF5 with no effect
on user applications. Since HDF have not yet finalized their plans to
ensure backward compatibility, we don't know what the implications for
existing NeXus files are yet. I have added some notes to the
introduction to the NeXus API.

**Friday, September 4, 1998**:

Mark Koennecke has provided an IDL 5.1 interface to the NeXus API. I have included
links to it in the API section. I also updated the Status section.

**Friday, April 17, 1998**:

The NAPI code has been updated on the FTP site to
change the type specification in NXgetattr from char \\*data to void
\\*data.

**Tuesday, April 14, 1998**:

Although there have been no major changes to the NeXus web pages for several months, there has been
considerable activity behind the scenes in developing the NeXus API. A
CVS (Concurrent Versions System) server has been set up by Freddie
Akeroyd to coordinate those involved in developing the NeXus API. The
FTP site has just been updated to the latest version of the API, and we
intend to provide more examples of its use very soon, in order to make
the operation of NeXus easier to understand. The new version of the API
does define the NX\\\_ datatypes so I have removed the previous
instructions to use the HDF DFNT\\\_ datatypes in the API section. From
now on, we encourage the use of the NX\\\_ datatypes to ensure
compatibility with future versions of the API. In order to ensure the
most efficient reads and writes in each language, the Fortran API has
been amended so that the array index order is reversed from that in C
i.e. a set of time-of-flight spectra for 150 detectors with 800 time
channels would be stored as S(800,150) in Fortran and
S\\[150\\]\\[800\\] in C i.e. the actual values are stored in the same
order but addressed differently in the two languages. At the moment,
this means that there would be a discrepancy in the meaning of the
axis attribute in NXdata groups, unless the NeXus files are written
and read in the same language. We have not yet decided how to address
this issue, though the most likely is that the axis attribute will
have to have different meanings in the two languages i.e. in C, axis=1
will refer to the first dimension whereas in Fortran, it will refer to
the last. If you have any views on this vexed subject, please address
them to the NeXus mailing list. Thursday, February 12, 1998:The latest
version of openGenie can read and write NeXus files. Check the openGenie
web pages for more details.

1997
----

**Monday, August 25, 1997**:

A few minor errors in the example programs in the NeXus API section have been
corrected. Following Freddie Akeroyd's suggestion, I have added a
conversion table from C to Fortran for the subroutine arguments. Some of
the instrument descriptions have been modified to make them simpler. The
aim of this section is to give the minimum required parameters for
meaningful data analysis although, in general, people will want to store
extra information. Installation instructions have been added to the end
of the API section.

**Thursday, August 14, 1997**:

As I warned, we have moved the FTP site to its semi-permanent location. Look for the API at <>. The
web pages have been updated accordingly.

**Sunday, August 10, 1997**:

A discussion of the storage of histograms in NXdata groups to the NeXus
structure chapter has been added following some comments by Phil Seeger
(LANL). Phil Seeger also pointed out that we had omitted to specify the
storage of data errors. This has been added to the NeXus glossary.

**Friday August 8, 1997**:

The FTP URLs have been moved to <> because of some
problems with the original server. This is a temporary move, so please
check these pages before downloading future versions of the API. A set
of helper routines designed to simplify the base API by combining
multiple function calls into a single function call ,e.g. NXmakedata,
NXopendata and NXputdata, is under development. This may be ready in the
next week, so watch this space. There will be a symposium during ICNS'97
in Toronto in order to present the NeXus proposal to the neutron
scattering community, and to receive feedback on its design. It will be
held at 8pm on Tuesday evening in McLennan Physical Laboratories room
134, adjacent to where the poster sessions are being held.
