      .. rubric:: NeXus Workshop at PSI (May 10 - 12, 2010)
         :name: nexus-workshop-at-psi-may-10---12-2010

      A NeXus workshop will be held at PSI from Monday, May 10 till
      Wednesday, May 12 2010. The purpose of this workshop is twofold:

      -  Disseminate detailed knowledge about the NeXus data format
      -  Discuss and develop the application of NeXus at synchrotron
         light sources.

      In a sense this workshop is a followup to the recent `HDF-5 as
      hyperspectral
      dataformat <http://www.esrf.eu/events/conferences/hdf5-as-hyperspectral-data-analysis-format>`__
      held at ESRF.

      This workshop is to go into more detail and come up with:

      -  A wishlist of things to consider for the `NeXus International
         Advisory Committee <../niac/niac.html>`__
      -  A set of synchrotron specific application definitions.

      The intended audience for this workshop are facility scientists
      and computing staff from synchrotrons who have have an interest to
      learn more about NeXus and use it a synchrotron light sources. The
      general part of the workshop can be of interest to other NeXus
      users too.

      Particiaption is free but due to space contraints we can only
      accept 30 participants. Registration is now open through our
      WWW-site:
