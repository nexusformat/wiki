         :name: Telco_20180403_stem

      The proposed STEM structure is a promising early draft that
      required more detail. Some discussion of the proposed NeXus
      structure took place in the LiberTEM ticket system. We should aim
      to keep this in view of the NeXus community. TSR to send out a
      reply.

      .. rubric:: NXpdb to PDB converter
         :name: nxpdb-to-pdb-converter

      That is work in progress, existing as a branch in cbflib. Some
      discussion on the difference between NXcollection and NXpdb. The
      only common point is that both have no validation in NXDL. NXpdb,
      however, has a full validation route, all content is standardised
      (outside of NXDL) and can be consumed by analysis software. None
      of that is true for NXcollection content. We have two different
      base classes to make the distinction as clear as possible.

      .. rubric:: Release Procedure
         :name: release-procedure

      Was presented as linked above. Some edits were done to also tick
      boxes in the definitions ticket
      `#597 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/597>`__
      for the new versioning scheme.

      Not enough time was left to discuss the tickets going into the
      next milestone.
