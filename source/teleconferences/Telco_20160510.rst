      Quite a list that we went through. Selection of activity below.

      Missing obscure build features should be an option, not the
      default: #420 and #425

      Support for HDF5 1.10 should be simple to add and we   ll make this
      happen shortly. They API flag was even used before, but may have
      been dropped. All could just work out of the box. (#421)

      #. 329 to be merged.

      #. 364 assigned.

      .. rubric:: Items for NIAC
         :name: Telco_20160510_items-for-niac

      Looked at https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/labels/NIAC

      The idea is to prepare some topics in advance to make real
      progress.

      While writing the minutes an Github issue repo has been created
      for the upcoming NIAC discussions, primed with the results of our
      collection of topics: https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues
      To be reviewed.

      .. rubric:: Change to NXdata documentation
         :name: change-to-nxdata-documentation

      Apparently it has become practise by at least certain developers
      at a certain facility to just dump all data into NXdata. This is
      clearly not good practise, because the extra dataset are confusing
      and serve no purpose there. However the wording to prevent this is
      tricky to get right. Adding useful data should still be possible
      in order to be flexible and able to develop the standard. NXdata
      is no different from any other place in the file in that respect.

      A general call for tidiness might be the right thing. We   ll work
      on a suggestion for the manual.
