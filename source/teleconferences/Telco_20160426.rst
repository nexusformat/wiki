      .. rubric:: Dectris Eiger Streaming Format
         :name: dectris-eiger-streaming-format

      Andreas got up early in the US weat coast and fought admirably
      against a poor network link in order to provide us with an
      overview of the Eiger image streaming format. Information can be
      found here: https://www.dectris.com/eiger.html This all looks good
      and allows good integration of a detector into local
      infrastructure. The main worry was that people could write the
      flat format to file and call this    NeXus light   . That will be
      addressed in the documentation.

      .. rubric:: Github Issues
         :name: Telco_20160426_github-issues

      -  NXroot: https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/466
         simple to fix, assigned
      -  Missing symbols: https://github.com/nexusformat/code/issues/414
         still not understood, but reverted to a state that should have
         been working, awaiting tests
      -  variable length strings:
         https://github.com/nexusformat/code/issues/329 is an important
         issue, but ugly to implement, hence not many volunteers,
         assigned to Mark K thankfully.

      .. rubric:: The New Landing Page Project (TNLPP)
         :name: the-new-landing-page-project-tnlpp

      Some progress, but no demoable prototype. Ray will update at the
      Telco after the next

      .. rubric:: Competing standard
         :name: competing-standard

      Compiled a rough list of imgCIF, CXI, Data Exchange, TIFF, EDF,
      plus things that are worse and more loosely defined.

      This was to list them in a overview slide in a presentation on
      NeXus.

      .. rubric:: Research Projects
         :name: research-projects
