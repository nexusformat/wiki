      In June, PC has promised to review the code for the NeXus
      ontology. He reports that comments have been provided, but that no
      further actions have happened yet.

      The `European HDF users group summer 2021
      meeting <https://www.hdfgroup.org/hug/europeanhug21/>`__ was
      attended by a few NeXus representatives. BW commented that the
      talk on the HDF5 embedded user functions looks very powerful, but
      far too risky for widespread adoption. AB commented that it would
      solve his issues of online data normalisation that he is currently
      addressing via a custom reader in DIALS that has a hardcoded
      formula and knows where to find the relevant pedestal and gain
      values to apply.

      Further discussion on adding NXcounts as a NeXus unit showed that
      nobody present objected to such an addition, but some wanted to
      make sure that there was full opportunity for anyone on the NIAC
      to raise an objection. It was not clear that the addition of
      NXcounts was significant enough to warrant a full NIAC vote (maybe
      the omission is just a bug that needs fixing, rather than a change
      to the stadard), so BW suggested starting by posting on the NIAC
      mailing list to request opinions.

      Revisiting the question about `scanning in
      NXfluo <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/933>`__
      with the new info from the issue creator, it seems that NXstxm is
      a good fit. MK commented that NeXus has a general scanning
      strategy, but it isn"t formally written down. This would make a
      good project for a future code camp.

      A new issue requests `adding MetalJet as a new NXsource
      type <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/934>`__.
      There is general agreement that new laboratory X-ray sources have
      been developed and are common enough to merit a new NXsource type.
      However, BW thinks that MetalJet might be too narrow and that
      "liquid jet" might be a more appropriate category name since there
      also exists X-ray sources based on jets of
      `nitrogen <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1884186>`__ or
      `water <https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4913585>`__. BW will ask for
      further opinions on the mailing list.

      New NDXL images BW questions anySimpleType, PJ says it comes from
      XML. https://www.w3schools.com/XML/schema_simple.asp

      AB brought up again the request to `add a git revision attribute
      to
      NXentry <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/937>`__.
      While it was generally agreed that people were free to add extra
      info to their files, there were some questions about the merits of
      any strategy that would require knowing the git revision rather
      than just the NeXus release version. AB was unsure (and would ask
      his collaboarators), but thought is was about being able to find
      the full NXDL specifications online. It was noted that the
      `releases page for the github
      repository <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/releases>`__
      listed the commit ids together with the release versions and that
      this might be helpful.

      Since many people expect to be busy in the end of August, the next
      telco will aim for early to mid september.
