         :name: Telco_20170308_agenda

      -  Welcome and agree Agenda
      -  wiki & website move

         -  any outstanding problems
         -  return of user pages

      -  Github NIAC repo & minutes in communication
      -  Questions below from Dectris (Andreas - Tobias edited for
         markdown) in preparation of the `HDRMX
         Meeting <https://indico.maxiv.lu.se/event/233/overview>`__. For
         convenience here are links to
         `NXdetector <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXdetector.html#nxdetector>`__
         and
         `NXmx <https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXmx.html#nxmx>`__.

         -  ``dead_time``, ``detector_readout_time`` and ``frame_time``
            are defined as ``NX_FLOAT``. ``count_time`` is defined as
            ``NX_NUMBER``, all four with units=\ ``NX_TIME``. Shouldn"t
            the parameters be of the same data type
         -  ``frame_time`` is described as
            ``exposure_time + readout time``. To be consistent with the
            other parameters, this should be
            ``count_time + detector_readout_time``.
         -  ``sensor_material`` is described as "the name of this
            converter material" for "radiation [..] not directly sensed
            by the detector". Can this description be expanded to
            include directly detected radiation
         -  Same for ``sensor_thickness``.
         -  ``flatfield_applied`` is currently called
            ``flatfield_correction_applied``. This is arguably in better
            agreement with ``angular_calibration_applied``. Can we keep
            it
         -  Are the group names binding or only their NX classes For
            example, EIGER calls the ``NXcollection`` group
            ``detectorSpecific``, not ``collection``. Similarly, the
            ``NXdetector_module`` group is planned to be called
            ``module`` not ``detector_module``.
         -  What does the required parameter
            ``/entry/instrument/detector/data[np,i,j]`` entail
         -  A parameter like ``detector_number`` that gives the serial
            number should be made mandatory. Or it could be an attribute
            to ``/entry/instrument/detector/description``

      No issues reported, no strong desire to keep user pages. They will
      be removed and can be reinstated by pull requests from the
      individuals if they so wish.

      Decision was to keep them in the website repo only. Remaining
      copies will be deleted.

      -  times will be changed to the general NX_NUMBER
      -  frame_time clarifcation with the field names actually used is
         good.
      -  sensor material and thickness: The documentation is both
         needless specific and vague. The suggestion was to speak of the
         "active" material.
      -  flatfield renaming: We should check whether that has found
         active use and only change if not. HDRMX meeting in Lund next
         week will be used.
      -  group names in application definitions can be made nameless, as
         in this case. Any name for a group of the right type is
         acceptable
      -  data is a link to the data
      -  ``detector_number`` is already taken for an ``INT``. We propose
         to define a new string type ``serial_number``.

      Aaron had some questions to the use of the new and improved NXlog.
      There was some discussion around the expected chronological order
      in there. There was some agreement that sorting cannot always be
      guaranteed, but no random ordering should be allowed.

      The also have the intention of storing data that could lend itself
      to using ragged arrays. That is not something perceived to be
      simple to get right. Aaron will prepare some example and email
      that around for comments.
