      -  Discuss how NeXus operates and answer questions from LNLS

         -  | How to add new definitions (e.g. IR beamline)
            | nyaml2nxdl
              (https://github.com/nomad-coe/nomad-parser-nexus)

         -  | How can NeXus be compatible to DAQ (field names)
            | a) create NeXus master file and use multiple files if
              needed via hdf5 links
            | b) 3-slider intro:
              https://anl.box.com/s/cbaohim9nhnmmy0a3lwsd963if01z641
            | c) standardized names allows interoperability, but
            | d) any other data can also be pushed to the data file

         -  | How NeXus can be compatible to cataloguing solutions, like
              SciCAT
            | e.g. ingest feeds data from NeXus to ICat (e.g. using
              h5py)
            | only metadata for search is duplicated

         -  | How to avoid data duplications (metadata stored in NeXus,
              but also in EPICS archiver)
            | archiver is for engineers and beamline staff, while NeXus
              is for scientists and users

         -  | What NIAC is for
            | definitions (application, base, contributed)
            | validator and tools (C and python for hdf5)

         -  | Is it possible to deal with multi-dimensional datasets,
              like time resolved 5D datasets
            | yes, in the contributed definitions MPES
              (https://fairmat-experimental.github.io/nexus-fairmat-proposal/),
              we easily work with 6 dimensions. H5Web
              (https://h5web.panosc.eu/) can be used to display 2D
              slides and use sliders to walk through the full datasets

         -  | SIRIUS status
            | SIRIUS is using hdf5 and some harminisation between
              beamlines just started. Next step can be the adaptation of
              NeXus base classes wherever applicable and then adding new
              ones if needed. Similarly Application Definitions can be
              used.
