      -  General requirements for changing definitions:

         -  modification in Base Classes or Application Definitions
            which affect reading and writing files: vote is needed
         -  fixing documentation or bugs: PR and review is needed anyone
            can issue a PR, but it is suggested to
            work in a small groups (with domain experts)

      -  AB: Topic suggested by Dectris - `PR
         #1246 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1246>`__
         NX_CHAR_OR_NUMBER to be used for NXdata/AXISNAME
         NX_CHAR_OR_NUMBER NX_CHAR, NX_NUMBER

         -  MK: make labels separate from NUMBER typed AXISNAME,
            e.g. AXISNAME@index_labels(NX_CHAR): array of NX_CHAR labels
         -  RO: one shall demonstrate how to use it (e.g matplotlib)
         -  SB: nxpy, H5web - others plotting applications
         -  AB/PJ: going with MK we do not break the standard
         -  Conclusion: AB will be taking it back to Dectris for further
            discussion, to see if indirection is acceptable.

      -  | AB:
           `#940 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/940>`__
         | threshold_1_channel(NXdetector_channel) threshold_energy is
           it generic enough

      -  | PM:
           `#1247 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1247>`__
         | discussion deferred until next time.

      -  WdN
         `#1212 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1212>`__
         WdN: presented ambiguities around the interpretation of
         NXdata/@AXISNAME_indices

         -  Use Case 1:
            axes=[[xp,xq],y,[z,time]] referreing to a 3D dataset
            where the 1st axis can be labeled by both xp, and xq, the
            second by y, and the 3rd by both z and time.
         -  Use Case 2:
            axes=[x,y,z]
            x_indices=0,1 (x is a 2D array to specify x for each column
            along z)
            y_indices=0,1 (y is a 2D array )
            from this one can do a 2D plot for each slice along z where
            the z values at (i,j) are ploted at the position
            (x(i,j),y(i,j)).
         -  Note that documentation says that the size of axes "must
            must" be the same as the rank of the signal array, which
            must be a bug.
         -  MK: maybe axes could be an array of lists (as demonstrated
            above) to make it clear and then we do not even need
            AXISNAME_indices
         -  RO: these are around for a while, but is there anyone who
            are using them
         -  AB: proposal for Wout to take the discussion and make a PR
            that is what he thinks is the best approach. We"ll use that
            as a discussion point for next time.

      -  PM
         `#412 <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/412>`__
         Documentation for NXdetector should be cleaned and updated
