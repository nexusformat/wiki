         :name: main-landing-page

      RO is preparing something, no update today

      .. rubric:: Github Issues
         :name: Telco_20160315_github-issues

      Closed a few that on short inspection didn   t require any more
      more.

      Recent work on updating copyright notices was welcome

      Stale Branches: Identified some candidates for deletion and some
      that have valuable commits.

      .. rubric:: Eiger JSON Streaming Format
         :name: eiger-json-streaming-format

      Eiger has three outputs: NeXus/HDF5, Monitor and Streaming
      (zeroMQ)

      For the streaming the detector uses some JSON for metadata (plus
      binary blob). The JSON string labels are short without hierarchy.

      After a discussion: There is nothing we can do to help their
      broken mapping. JSON could be fixed easily, but maybe for their
      needs that is good enough as well. Will pick up the discussion if
      there is input or a proposal from Dectris or another party
      interested to engage.

      .. rubric:: cnxvalidate
         :name: Telco_20160315_cnxvalidate

      No testing reported - PJ was happy to hear about the tool though.

      .. rubric:: NAPI release
         :name: napi-release

      All releases downloadable from d.n.o/kits should be on github.
      Same is true for definitions. d.n.o/kits can go (redirect to
      github).

      Debian: Eugen is planning to make progress some time this year.
