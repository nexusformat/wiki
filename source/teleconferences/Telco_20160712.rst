         :name: Telco_20160712_github-issue

      Support for HDF5 1.10 in NAPI:
      https://github.com/nexusformat/code/issues/421

      If the test run that should be good enough to merge. Release 4.4.2
      can go out after that merge, without the changes to fix attribute
      arrays on HDF4 and XML in C++.

      This adds support for reading SWMR files that are closed and VDS.
      This is great. Further support for these advanced features in
      writing data or reading while writing would require changes to the
      API and or how the library is used. For example in SMWR you cannot
      create new objects once in SWMR mode. Adding VDS support would be
      even harder. Eugen   s PNI library currently has support for
      neither.

      So for the moment that will be the extend of 1.10 support we
      offer, for NAPI in maintenance mode - unless there are convincing
      cases presented by the community,

      Not all able to attend the whole week.

      Will need to elect new officers and re-confirm NIAC members.
      Letters of support need to be produced ahed of the meeting
      (September) for this.

      Bit of a summer break, due to leave. So the next one will be
