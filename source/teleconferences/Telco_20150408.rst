      Small meeting. Just EW, HJB and TR.

      Discussions on the future of MX detectors.

      Some progress made on cmake build for the definitions and
      documentation.

      Need to get NAPI release out. The current one is outdated (more
      than two years old) and master has new features. During that we
      found some ancient download content on the WIKI and non-editable
      on download.nexformat.org. Need to update or remove. Eugen to look
      into.

      Will look for good slot for next meeting.
