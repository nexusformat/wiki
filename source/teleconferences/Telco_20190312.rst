         :name: Telco_20190312_nexus-for-fels

      AB reports that work has been progressing on implementing NeXus
      for single shot crystallography experiments at the European XFEL
      (and SwissFEL). While still a work-in-progress, the code has
      already had a first use in an experiment at the Europeean XFEL.
      HJB commented on an issue that a requirement for an extra geometry
      file wasn't properly documented. AB noted that it is because of a
      shortcut (reusing existing code) that will be fixed soon.

      .. rubric:: Dectris NeXus
         :name: dectris-nexus

      HJB and AB continue to work on improving the NeXus output of
      Dectris detectors.
