      -  | https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1312
         | accepted as bugfix

      -  | https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1310
         | AB: recommendation should be clear and we should add code
           snippets to help the community
         | PM: are test cases available
         | SB: yes, we have prepared test cases and code snippets what
           we can share.

      -  | https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1246
         | AB: Detector Channel, @default_slice is added
         | WdN: detector channel can be auxiliary_signal
         | AB: channel is more than a simple auxiliary_signal as it has
           additional metadata
         | HB: Is VDS assumed to be supported If so, old hdf5 libs
           (<1.10) should be deprecated. It should be a separate issue
           to be voted on.
         | SB: NeXus does not expect officially hdf5 as a backend, but
           we could recommend a min version of hdf5 if it is used.
         | LG: NeXus is a data format and not a file format
         | AB: Yes, but we can give examples on how to write a file
           using hdf5
         | SB: NXdata is independent of NXdetector, but
           NXdetector/plot[NXdata] can be specialised to use channels as
           auxiliary_signals if needed.
         | AB: Let us call in Dectris, and discuss it with them next
           week
