      -  NIAC 2024 During the meeting, ensure people that are remote are
         notified that a vote is coming. Need time for offline people to
         digest proposals before votes.
         Use plenary vs working sessions, multiple of each per day
      -  NeXus front page says next meeting is code camp 2023
      -  Reviewed schema bugfixes in
         https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1370

         -  PM: sidestep by setting up a different way of specifying
            examples (nxdl namespace for example).
         -  PJ: this is about how to provide examples of unit types in
            the nexus schema. Each unit type needs an example to avoid
            confusionRevisit discussion of general

      -  NXtransformations

         -  AB: NXtransformations that are rotations are full basis
            transformations: rotation + the vector offsetHJB:
            non-problem, as transformation type can be omitted, for
            'general' basis definitions like gravity
         -  PM: is there an example with the current NXtransformations
            are insufficient

      -  PM: upcoming EU funding may be available from a broad project
         that includes photons/neutrons.

         -  There are open calls for 1-2 year projects, 1 FTE.
         -  We could apply for some funding to update toolage.
         -  Call in spring (opens this friday) and sept.
         -  AB: remember what the NIAC is: specs,
            docs/examples/validator. Maybe validator help would be
            useful
         -  MK: cnxvalidate could use an update Should we have a
            reimplementation in python
         -  AB: Touch base with Ray for some NeXpy support
         -  PM: will think and maybe bring a proposal back
         -  HB: include h5py if working on NeXpy
         -  PM: looking for a library that exposes base class as python
            types
         -  PJ: punx has this (AB to what extent):
            https://github.com/prjemian/punx
         -  RB: has a nxstixm file validator:
            https://github.com/RussBerg/nxstxm_validator
         -  RB: has code for autogenerating NeXus files
