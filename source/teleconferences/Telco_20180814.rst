      The small congregation in this telco opted for having a NIAC on
      October 18 & 19 (Thursday and Friday before NOBUGS). TSR will ask
      SIC if that can be arranged. No code camp.

      AB met someone at the latest Gordon Conference, doing Eiger work.
      Two use cases where unclear: Serial crystallography via a raster
      scan of a plate with multiple crystals and scans with a limited
      amount of fixed angles, say 0, 45, 90 degree. MK said that both
      should be well supported via NXtransformation scans, especially
      when the raster scan does not need to define multiple
      distinguished samples. AB will check this out.
