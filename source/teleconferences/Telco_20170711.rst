      Present: MB, MK, PJ, AB, TSR, EW, FA, HJB

      .. rubric:: Code Camp 2017
         :name: Telco_20170711_code-camp-2017

      Target is last week of October, for about three days, hosted by
      DLS.

      .. rubric:: Ongoing Projects
         :name: ongoing-projects

      .. rubric:: Release 3.3
         :name: release-33

      Looks like it is ready to go. There is an automated script that
      generates release notes. Mid term they could move into the wiki
      part of that repo space.

      Target date for the next release is January, or maybe earlier at
      the Code Camp

      .. rubric:: PDB
         :name: Telco_20170711_pdb

      All are in agreement that this is a good idea. HJB talks to
      COMCIFS and COMDATA around the IUCr meeting in August. We can look
      at the implementation at the code camp.

      .. rubric:: NXcontainer
         :name: Telco_20170711_nxcontainer

      Nothing to report and on the back burner. DLS suggested dropping
      from the agenda until some progress is made there.

      .. rubric:: Identifying data sources in NXdata
         :name: identifying-data-sources-in-nxdata

      DLS have prepared and example and no one could come up with a
      better proposal. They will put this to the test in practise now.

      .. rubric:: NXslit
         :name: Telco_20170711_nxslit

      We clarified the preferences raised in emails and the ticket
      system with the conclusion that "left" and "right" are
      unnecessarily vague concepts possibly overloaded with local
      conventions. Positive/negativ x/y direction is directly tied to
      the NeXus coordinate systen and will be the choice for the new
      proposal.

      .. rubric:: CSPAD
         :name: Telco_20170711_cspad

      We did not discuss the CSPAD, but aligning timestamped data in
      NXlogs written with different frequencies using the cue indices.

      AB would like to see some full example file. TSR may have one or
      could create one for one of the next meetings. MB indicated the
      same. Would be nice to compare.

      .. rubric:: Ragged arrays
         :name: ragged-arrays

      They are more of an HDF5 problem than a NeXus one. There is no
      simple efficient way to deal with them. Either you end up with
      many unused chunks and lots of metadata or you need to flatten the
      dimensions and have a run length index dataset. AB will
      investigate relative merits with LCLS people.

      .. rubric:: HDF5 filters repo
         :name: hdf5-filters-repo

      Eugen is making progress on simplifying the build system, which is
      currently too complex to maintain.

      Dropped due to lack of time.
