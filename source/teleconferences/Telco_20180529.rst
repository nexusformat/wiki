      Interested parties had a productive Telco meeting earlier today.
      STEM community is implementing a file writing scheme that follows
      what was developed at the meeting.

      There will be some adjustments as the suggested use of
      NXpositonier is not widely adopted in NeXus. NXtransformations
      work better for encoding the geometry. There are some open
      questions regarding scanning, which could be addressed with the
      new NXlog scheme or the standard scan rules.

      Other areas of interest are default plots (NXdata), for which a
      solution exists, and OS level thumbnails which hopefully can be
      distributed soon. See:
      https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/381

      Dieter will send out a new draft pixelated STEM file to the NeXus
      mailing list to gather feedback and develop a next iteration.

      Still no update from the organisers on exact dates NOBUGS and
      related events. Making other arrangements is becoming more likely.
