      Some mixup with Hangout, session was split for the first 10
      minutes.

      https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/602

      Ray will edit and present next time. uncertainties should be
      perferred over the old \_errors.

      Action on all: Resolve all possible issues; at the next meeting
      advaocate then unresolved tickets that still should be part of the
      upcoming release. We still establish the target date then.

      .. rubric:: multiple signals, ESRF proposal
         :name: multiple-signals-esrf-proposal

      (This took quite some time, just noting down one strand of the
      exchange.)

      PJ: Support for generic plotting is a main goal of NeXus.

      RO: Adding multiple signals does not explain to a program what to
      do with that additional data.

      MK: Could suggest features to solve this.

      TSR: auxiliary_axes is a solved problem. Any number of axes are
      possible with \_indices.

      PJ: That could have been to use with the additional (auxillary)
      signal.

      TSR: That would generate more problems (indices). Next action

      PJ: Ball in Armando's court to provide examples.

      Mark may mean this:
      https://github.com/nexusformat/HDF5-External-Filter-Plugins But if
      that doesn't satisfy his needs, bring it up next time (or on the
      mailing list).
