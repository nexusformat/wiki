      Hi.

      .. rubric:: Github Issue
         :name: Telco_20160412_github-issue

      All agree those removed functions are not only for internal use
      and must be available to external code. Eugen will take care of
      that.

      .. rubric:: Lastest News
         :name: lastest-news

      The page is a little under used and not even linked from the home
      page. If use does not pick up, we may drop it.

      No show from Andreas this time. We hope for the next meeting.

      No update. Ray will restart efforts.

      .. rubric:: Next Meeting
         :name: Telco_20160412_next-meeting

      Will be `Telco 20160426 <Telco_20160426.html>`__

      Ray says there is interest in linking remote NeXus files to read
      trees and not all of the data. It   s not as simple as having a URL
      scheme for links (which we do), there also needs to be an API. He
      has that with remote python. HDF Group have something similar with
      a RESTful interface
      https://hdfgroup.org/wp/2015/04/hdf5-for-the-web-hdf-server/ That
      may be a better bandwaogn to jump on.

      They have lost of key members of staff. There is some concern
      about the future.
