      -  UH presented some further info on photoemission spectroscopy of
         liquid surfaces (using synchrotron excitation sources on
         microjet targets). The NXarpes application definition has many
         required elements, but is not fitting in some ways requiring
         some extra data dimensions and missing important sample
         information (liquid jet).

         -  Advice is to write a new application definition and new or
            amended base classes.
         -  For the description of light polarisation, the Stokes
            parameters are recommended and HB will present something on
            the topic at the next telco.

      -  RC asks if anyone had used `NXdector_module to describe a
         ROI <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/939>`__
      -  Dectris would like to be able to add an extra `"channel"
         dimension <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/940>`__
         to the data array that their detectors record. The issue seems
         to be driven by the feature of automatic thresholding where the
         gain settings of a pixel self-adjusts based on its rate of
         charge acquisition and therefore the gain and offset that
         should be applied depends on which thresholds were exceeded.
         More discussion is probably needed as the proposal indtroduces
         new complexity to some fundamental parts of NeXus.
      -  "axes" as a dataset attribute should be marked as "deprecated"
