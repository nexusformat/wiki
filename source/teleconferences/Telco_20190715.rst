      -  BW to attend and represent NeXus.
      -  HB has been seeing many bugs when trying to run the .10 version
         in high-performance situations. Detectors like the Eiger need a
         parallel file system (e.g. GPFS) to keep up with the data rate,
         but the HDF5 library has not been very stable.

         -  We should ask the HDF group to please stabilise the
            HDF5_1.10 library on parallel file systems.
         -  Perhaps we can help organise facilities to combine efforts
