      New Ticket for the remaining work on NXatom_site opened, this one
      closed.

      Done, closed.

      .. rubric:: 511
         :name: Telco_20161213_511

      Decided for    px    as    unit   . Should be allowed for detectors only.
      Herbert makes a branch to test this out.

      .. rubric:: 486
         :name: Telco_20161213_486

      There were some problems getting the test site to compile. Those
      are resolved. By the next meeting Pete and Ray think they can have
      a test site up to demonstrate the plans for the new home page.

      .. rubric:: Wiki
         :name: wiki

      If we move having the main website on new foundations, dropping
      the wiki has consensus. The main content this is kept up to date
      there is the NIAC related information and these minutes. No
      collaborative editing by community members is happening. Even for
      that the workflow would be sensible through github pull requests.
      Maintaining pages on a low traffic wiki is more difficult than
      working with a repo.

      .. rubric:: uncertainties
         :name: Telco_20161213_uncertainties

      According to the decision by the NIAC this is allowed everywhere.
      A plural vs singular change was no longer requested. canSAS works
      on a    resolution    field and will come up with a full example that
      would inform the documentation of this feature.

      .. rubric:: interfaces vs features
         :name: interfaces-vs-features

      Progress is made, nothing to show at the moment.

      Travis now texts the nxdl commits to the definitions repo (broken
      shortly after the meeting, by work on ticket 511, expect
      operations to resume shortly).
