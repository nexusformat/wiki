         :name: issue-748

      -  NXreflections describes diffraction spots in a tabular format,
         having evolved from historical practice of attributing and
         recording diffraction spots from film-based photographs.
      -  it is a base class and not an appdef (currently)
      -  Both versions (base class and AppDef) have use cases.
      -  An Appdef should be written that has NXreflections as a major
         component so that it can be used together with NXmx AB brings
         up related Pull Request #767

         :name: issue-762

      -  user def keys should be negative
      -  extra (or subgroup of fields) fields (NXnotes) needed to
         describe user def keys

         -  Need stadardised name for description

      -  any new positive key should be NIAC approved

      AB asks MK: base classes can"t be a subentry

      -  subentries must be AppDef
      -  entries can also be AppDef

      -  HB suggests doing what the PDB community does and have a list
         of registered prefixes
      -  starting with an underscore didn"t work out for PDB
      -  NIAC should grant power for approving prefix registration
      -  BW suggests prefixes be in uppercase to make them obvious to
         human readers
      -  PJ suggests prefixes be followed by an underscore
      -  PJ will post new issue with proposal for the NIAC

      -  PC asks NXuser for a group of users

         -  MK suggests using multiple instances of NXuser

      -  PC ask: is there a way to give numerical precision

         -  should be applicable to any general field
         -  Outside of current scope - someone needs to propose a method
            - perhaps as an attribute

      -  HG asks: How has NeXus been approaching ontologies and mapping
         metadata betwen formats

         -  NeXus predates much of the current academic interest in
            ontologies
         -  PJ suggests talking to a group at the ALS
         -  PJ asks if there is a general Ontology that NeXus can fit
            within
         -  HG says that ontologies tend to sit next to each other as
            peers, rather than under an umbrella ontology

      -  PJ points to the index of the NeXus definitions as a starting
         point to mapping the NeXus ontology

         -  HG will create new GitHub issue for a published NeXus
            ontology
         -  PJ proposed using information from the manual"s index as a
            starting point
         -  PJ noted that various items of NeXus structure (group,
            field, attribute) are automatically indexed
         -  MK noted that position in hierarchy is important since some
            terms (such as ``name``) have multiple meanings
         -  ontology should include

            -  `NeXus class
               path <https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#index-15>`__
               to specify hierachy position
            -  documentation content from the NXDL for each item listed

      Next telco: Mid May, using a poll in the same manner as
      previously.
