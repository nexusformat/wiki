Agenda

Present

HB, PC, CZ, BB, LG, AB, SB, PM, WdN



Minutes
-------

* https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1312  
accepted as bugfix

* https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1310  
AB: recommendation should be clear and we should add code snippets to help the community  
PM: are test cases available?  
SB: yes, we have prepared test cases and code snippets what we can share.  

* https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1246  
AB: Detector Channel, @default_slice is added  
WdN: detector channel can be auxiliary_signal  
AB: channel is more than a simple auxiliary_signal as it has additional metadata  
HB: Is VDS assumed to be supported? If so, old hdf5 libs (<1.10) should be deprecated. It should be a separate issue to be voted on.  
SB: NeXus does not expect officially hdf5 as a backend, but we could recommend a min version of hdf5 if it is used.  
LG: NeXus is a data format and not a file format  
AB: Yes, but we can give examples on how to write a file using hdf5  
SB: NXdata is independent of NXdetector, but NXdetector/plot[NXdata] can be specialised to use channels as auxiliary_signals if needed.  
AB: Let us call in Dectris, and discuss it with them next week
