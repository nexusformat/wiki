Minutes

Present: EW, HJB, TSR, MK, FAA, AB

### Github and NAPI update

Nothing flagged. The longer running problem with the C++ API for the
legacy backends is (mostly) resolved and Mantid would like an update
release. Eugen will attempt to schedule that for next week,

### NIAC Meeting Preparations

Mark has written a draft and welcomes feedback. It's in the ticket for
now, because Tobias forgot to give anyone write access to the NIAC
repository. (Now fixed.)

### THG

THG has been in contact and we're asking them to provide us an update on
the current plans of THG at the upcoming code camp. Other topics are
OpneMP support, filter repositories and status.

### web site

No Ray, no update.

### AOB

Meeting in Basel is on the 2nd at 9:00 in room 102. HJB is in charge of
the sandwich supply.

RDA: There was a sort of survey by THG send round to RDA people on the
use of “hdf5 in the wild”. Forwarded to the committee mailing list.
