Minutes
-------

CMake

  
  
Eugen will look into CMake for everything. NAPI may be release as Linux
only using old build system, if required. We still need input from
Freddie. Mark B to help with that.

Code Camp

  
  
Dates 16-18 Nov appear to agree with all. Thanks Eugen!

Letter to Detector Vendors

  
  
Draft is in repository, comments weclome

Herbert suggests meeting detector vendors at ACA meeting in Philadelphia
in July. No one besides Herbert keen to go. Will check again next time.

Logo

  
  
Doodle poll or similar brought up as idea.

Flexible Tomo

  
  
Reply sent to KIT, pending response from there

Features

  
  
Mark B showed a nice Jenkins test of beamline NeXus status at DLS using
features. Code will be made available for others.

Next meeting
