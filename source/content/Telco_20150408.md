Minutes
-------

Small meeting. Just EW, HJB and TR.

Discussions on the future of MX detectors.

Some progress made on cmake build for the definitions and documentation.

Need to get NAPI release out. The current one is outdated (more than two
years old) and master has new features. During that we found some
ancient download content on the WIKI and non-editable on
download.nexformat.org. Need to update or remove. Eugen to look into.

Will look for good slot for next meeting.
