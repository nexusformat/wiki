https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1325

  - SB: mice to build custom units, but is it following any standard
  - CP: not really human readability and missing things like ANGLE
  - MK: other unit categories are also missing
  - BW: outcome is that it is interesting, but it should be made universal
* release:  
  - https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1231  
  - NXaperture vs. NXslit  
    - MK: NXslit is for simple 2-blades slits, but NXaperture is for more complex geometries (to be used with NXoff_geometry as SHAPE)
    - PJ: whenever we want to deprecate or undeprecate something, it shall be extremely well explained why we do so
    - MK: undeprecate NXaperture and make the documentation clear, so it can be properly used.  
  - After voting for this and merging 1271, we can do the relase
