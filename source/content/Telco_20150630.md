Minutes
-------

Present: HJB, EW, MK, MB, TSR

Axes for Detectors: All in favour. We should make this recommended at a
next NIAC meeting.

napi release: Treat recent poll as priority list for new build system
and provide incremental updates until no one objects to things missing.

Pull request 411: The placeholder is not independent of the “named” or
“any” options. So this does not look like a full solution. With the
removal of “placeholder” that completely fixes the current problem (Mark
B to check with Peter C). Would like to check with Pete J, but then it
looks reasonable.

Tickets: Not much progress. Do comment on every ticket looked at, if you
think it is done or summarising outstanding items. Aim to close one per
person over summer.
