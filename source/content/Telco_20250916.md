Minutes
-------
- AB: we have 10 open PRs for the [release](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/13)
- [PR 1532](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1532)
  - FdA: approved PR 1532 with 2 questions
  - AB: questions are answer, can be merged 
- [PR 1587](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1587)
  - AB: PR 1587. Why gitlab ci/cd is here?
  - WdN/PC: It must be a mistake
  - WdN: It would be nice to have pages automatically rendered after a commit
  - SB: FAIR mat fork (https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/nexus_definitions) has that feature
  - PC: We could address it in a code camp.
  - AB: The content adds an enum, so we bring it to a vote!
- [PR 1577](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1577)
  - AB: What application does it cover?
  - SB: Why is not it a base class (e.g. extension of NXprocess), so it can be reused (e.g. inside application definitions, like NXxrd).
  - WdN: similar use as base class, like NXpeak. Let us discuss in the next Telco.
  - AB: let us put it to the next milestone.
  - SB: It could still be release now as a contributed definition while we can continue discussing it.
- [PR 1372](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1372)
  - AB: only small modifications
  - WdN: unnecessary prefix definitions should be cleaned up from NXDL files.
  - AB: The new definition ‘NXelectron_detector’ must be cleaned up, as well. As a bug fix it could be merged in when finalised.
- [PR 1377](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1377)
  - AB: It is now superseeded, so we close it.
- [PR 1412](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1412)
  - WdN: also NXspectrum and NXimage have detector_identifier. Also NXarchive is effected, just like some new: e.g. NXellipsometry, NXoptical_spectroscopy have data_identifier.
  - AB: instead of deprecating, let us make the new convention be compatible to old standard: NAMEidentifier. That requires all new definitions (including NXobject) to change (still before the official release)
- [PR 1582](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1582)
  - PC: we could check if we can do it with only python dependencies. 
  - AB: Let us merge the typos, but the CI only in the next release.
- [PR 1428](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1428)
  - AB: we are still interested in some solution which we could review.
  - WdN: group label in the xml could help in automating the process of making the special domain pages
- [PR 1039](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1039)
  - WdN: no more development resources available.
  - AB: we should merge it as it has passed a vote.
  - WdN: the new structure is not compatible anymore with the consortium agreement
  - AB: let us just accept it as is and please the consortium.
  - WdN: if we could render inherited optional elements, that would solve quite some resistance towards restructuring.
  - AB: let us try to finalize it as is and do any restructuring at a later stage.
