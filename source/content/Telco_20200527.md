NIAC 2020
----------

   * NOBUGS is going to be postponed until next year (probably May)
   * Will need to do the meeting remotely if we stick to the October dates.
   * Will probably need to run it more like a teleconference with a series of teleconferences to organise the topics and then break up into interest groups.
   * Need to have some discussion on the mailing list to make sure everyone is well informed.
   * Could still follow the NOBUGS meeting, maybe even doing both an October virtual meeting and a 2021 meeting with NOBUGS.
   * MK to check the previous NIAC minutes to clarify email voting procedures.
   
Any Other Business
------------------
   * AK has a pull request to be examined: 
   * Jungfrau dataset format is now fully NeXus compliant. passes cnxvalidate with no errors.
   * Soon the AGIP detector for EuXFEL will also be fully compliant.
   * PJ has created a [milestone NXDL2020.10](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/9) for all issues to be considered for next release of definitions.
   * PJ poked BW about making further progress on the logo issue. Will set up a repository on dropbox for people to contribute
   
   * Next meeting to aim for last week of June. BW will send out a doodle poll in advance to decide the exact date.
