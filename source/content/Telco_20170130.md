Minutes
-------

Present: EW, AB, HJB, MB, MK, TSR

### 511

Aaron will have a closer look to make sure this is sane.

### 486

No show by Ray. But we agreed moving the wiki out of mediawiki into
jekylls hands. Tobias will work with Freddie to extract the content.

### 177

Tobias accidentally deleted NXcharacterization in a failed attempt to
generate a pull request. No objections.

### features and interfaces

Deferred

### HDRMX Lund meeting

Herbert invited all interested parties to attend. Mark K suggested it is
a fun meeting from the Basel experience. Tobias will attend.

### RDA

Someone from Diamond will attend the Alba satellite meeting. Mark K
supports the idea a few people from the NeXus community should go. He'll
look into that, as will Tobias.

### Voting

Some of the recent online votes carried a clear majority of the votes
cast, but have failed to reach a quorum of votes from the eligible
members. The constitution does not see that as a problem explicitly, but
it would be nice if that was formally permitted. We'll bring that up at
the next NIAC.
