Present: FAA, HJB, EW, AB, TSR

-   HDF exploratory work at SLAC

  
  
Aaron mentioned some strong interest in file formats at SLAC recently
and that he can dedicate some time for proof of concept work in relation
to the CIF-NeXus concordance. Herbert agreed to work with him. If other
help is needed Aaron will let us know.

-   canSAS axes arrays vs. string parsing

  
  
It was agreed that there was no need to allow CVS axes in the newly
defined axes attribute to groups. One of the design goals was to remove
that source of trouble and not introduce more legacy. We'll revert the
change to the features repository and review the documentation to make
that clear.

-   sample container proposal - DLS
-   recording scan intent proposal - DLS
-   CXI update (Mark B) this time with better microphone and legal
    advise

  
  
No representation from DLS. No report.

-   Update from NAPI code and GitHub:
    -   Python code has been moved to its own repository
    -   Next NAPI release 4.4.1 scheduled for Friday 11, December 2015
    -   HDF5 external filter plugin repository is online on nexusformat

  
  
All happily acknowledged. There was a discussion on the various download
pages. Github may be a place where we can offer binary packages in the
future. EW will investigate. The goal should be that you cannot download
an old version from a page under our influence without being informed
that there is a new release out. So far only the mailing list knows and
if you happen to find the tarball on gitub.
