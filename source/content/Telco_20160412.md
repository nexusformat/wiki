### Welcome

Hi.

### Github Issue

All agree those removed functions are not only for internal use and must
be available to external code. Eugen will take care of that.

### Lastest News

The page is a little under used and not even linked from the home page.
If use does not pick up, we may drop it.

### Dectris JSON

No show from Andreas this time. We hope for the next meeting.

### Landing Page

No update. Ray will restart efforts.

### Next Meeting

Will be [Telco 20160426](Telco_20160426.html "wikilink")

### AOB

#### Remote Links

Ray says there is interest in linking remote NeXus files to read trees
and not all of the data. It's not as simple as having a URL scheme for
links (which we do), there also needs to be an API. He has that with
remote python. HDF Group have something similar with a RESTful interface
<https://hdfgroup.org/wp/2015/04/hdf5-for-the-web-hdf-server/> That may
be a better bandwaogn to jump on.

#### HDFGroup

They have lost of key members of staff. There is some concern about the
future.
