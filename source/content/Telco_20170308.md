Agenda
------

-   Welcome and agree Agenda
-   wiki & website move
    -   any outstanding problems
    -   return of user pages?
-   Github NIAC repo & minutes in communication
-   Questions below from Dectris (Andreas - Tobias edited for markdown) in preparation of the [HDRMX Meeting](https://indico.maxiv.lu.se/event/233/overview). For convenience here are links to [NXdetector](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/base_classes/NXdetector.html#nxdetector) and [NXmx](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXmx.html#nxmx).
    *   `dead_time`, `detector_readout_time` and `frame_time` are defined as `NX_FLOAT`.  `count_time` is defined as `NX_NUMBER`, all four with units=`NX_TIME`.  Shouldn't the parameters be of the same data type?
    *   `frame_time` is described as `exposure_time + readout time`.  To be consistent with the other parameters, this should be `count_time + detector_readout_time`.
    *   `sensor_material` is described as "the name of this converter material" for "radiation [..] not directly sensed by the detector".  Can this description be expanded to include directly detected radiation?
    *   Same for `sensor_thickness`.
    *   `flatfield_applied` is currently called `flatfield_correction_applied`.  This is arguably in better agreement with `angular_calibration_applied`.  Can we keep it?
    *   Are the group names binding or only their NX classes?  For example, EIGER calls the `NXcollection` group `detectorSpecific`, not `collection`.  Similarly, the `NXdetector_module` group is planned to be called `module` not `detector_module`.
    *   What does the required parameter `/entry/instrument/detector/data[np,i,j]` entail?
    *   A parameter like `detector_number` that gives the serial number should be made mandatory.  Or it could be an attribute to `/entry/instrument/detector/description`?

Minutes
-------

Present: MK, TSR, AB, AF, HJB, PJ

### Website Move

No issues reported, no strong desire to keep user pages. They will be removed and can be reinstated by pull requests from the individuals if they so wish.

### Triplicated Minutes

Decision was to keep them in the website repo only. Remaining copies will be deleted.

### Dectris Items

* times will be changed to the general NX_NUMBER
* frame_time clarifcation with the field names actually used is good.
* sensor material and thickness: The documentation is both needless specific and vague. The suggestion was to speak of the "active" material.
* flatfield renaming: We should check whether that has found active use and only change if not. HDRMX meeting in Lund next week will be used.
* group names in application definitions can be made nameless, as in this case. Any name for a group of the right type is acceptable
* data is a link to the data
* `detector_number` is already taken for an `INT`. We propose to define a new string type `serial_number`.

### LCLS HDF5

Aaron had some questions to the use of the new and improved NXlog. There was some discussion around the expected chronological order in there.
There was some agreement that sorting cannot always be guaranteed, but no random ordering should be allowed.

The also have the intention of storing data that could lend itself to using ragged arrays. That is not something perceived to be simple to get right.
Aaron will prepare some example and email that around for comments.
