Wikipedia page
------

* BW has written a short article in wikipedia about NeXus and invites comments:
   * "Domain specific ontology" is a major feature
   * Application definitions define strictness for each implementation of a NeXus format
   * Should add an example file structure
* BW to work on including these.

2019 NeXus Code Camp
------

* No further news regarding early November at Diamond.
* BW to contact MB.

Definitions
------

* PJ added this item to the agenda, but was not present at the meeting so we are not sure what he wanted to discuss.

Other Business
------

* HB will be at ECM32 in Vienna next week to discuss NXmx Eiger format.
* Next meeting to be in the beginning of September.
* We have been having fewer telco participants than have been indicated in the polls - technical problems or just overly busy people?
