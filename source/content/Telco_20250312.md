**APM**

**OptSpec**
[1425](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1425)
reviewers are not present, so skipped

**ambiguity (between DATA, and AXISNAME) when specialising NXdata**
[1523](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1523)
  
- RO argued that since in data processing time, there is a clear rule on how to distinguish between them and how to classify the datasets in NXdata, it is not interesting to know that in advance. Since it would effect also data validators, he asked for a use case where it would indeed matter! Also suggested to use \@signal and \@axis attributes on the FIELDNAMEs.

**NXcoordinate_system**
[1415](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1415)
  
- WdN gave his report and presented his questions. 
- HB: NXtransformations is coming from CBF where all the possibilities are defined.

  - https://github.com/dials/cbflib.git  
- LP and MK also answered the questions and explained its use using the attribute depends_on 
- HB, WdN: also asked the possibility of referencing community conventions
- WdN: suggested to make an application that uses example data, so it can be demonstrated
