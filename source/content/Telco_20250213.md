Minutes
-------

-  | Webpage migration to wiki

  - RB: the PR is still in progress
  - PC: there are missing links

-  | Voting Procedure

  - AB: not all failing should have failed. why were we short of votes
  - RB: missed the call, and so voted too late
  - BW: it was difficult also in the past to call people
  - AB: being a member means a responsibility for voting. Shall be asked if they want to be members
  - BW: culture has changed. Quorum requirement has added to keep robustness of the standard.
  - AB: Do we want to keep the quorum?

    1: Y (SB; HB yes, but smaller)
    2: N (BW no, majority is enough)

  - SB: Quorum is good, but not voting shall be considered as abstain
  - MarkusK: people may not vote because the topic is off from their expertise and field.
  - AB: yes, but members shall still take their responsibilities towards NIAC. We should approach those not voting.
  - AB: online vote period is not for discussion, but for voting.
  - SB: agreed, but these topics shall be reviewed after the vote
  - BW: agreed, but new ideas may result in a better solution, so new vote shall be put on
  - LukasP: May putting comments mean a NO vote? Is there a clear rule on it?
  - BW: maybe NIAC meeting with no quorum restriction could be held more frequently. In between, suggestion would not go to main, but to staging.
  - AB: on codecamps, quorum was difficult to get.
  - SB: those not voting in the given period (maybe 2 weeks is too small?), should be treated as abstain
  - AB: min 2 week, max 1 month
  - BW: it may not help if people simply do not show up
  - HB: allow designating a proxy if someone cannot vote

-  | PRs

  - [1408 ](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1408)

    - PM: I agree, my comments are not blocking. Only improvements on documentation (e.g. diagnostic point)
    - BW: instead of "diagnostic point", "location"
    - LukasP: "location" is also fine.
    - PM: agreed
    - BW: let us run a new vote
    - SB: after the modification, we can run a vote

  - [1519 ](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1519)

    - SB: it has the Quorum now (after having the late vote from RB)
    - LukasP: for Heike's comment: reference can be changed to a cheaper book
    - PC: yes, we can rerun the vote
    - SB: after the requested modification, we can run a vote

  - [1528 ](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1528)

    - PM: I checked and found other examples of use _value, so it should be OK as proposed. Let us just rerun the vote.
    - BW: _value can actually be omitted
    - PC: nameType=specified should be added to K_p
    - SB: after the requested modifications, we can run a vote

  - [1415 ](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1415)

    - WdN: What is it more than NXtransformations?
    - SB: it is a base of change in a single Group, and it also informs about the handedness of the coordinate system
    - PM: allows
    - LukasP: In XPS, ISO standard uses left handed system, in NeXus it was not available until now.
    - MarkusK: NXrotation_convention is an implementation of a community standard from materials engineering.
    - WdN: Let me make a small prototype for the usefulness of the proposal.
    - SB: after the requested modifications, and a positive feedback from WdN, we can run a vote
