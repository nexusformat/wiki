Minutes
-------

**Website**

- RB: Issues are mostly addressed. Last touches shall be done in a code camp. Let us wait for green light from PC before merging.

**EuXFEL**

- LG: suggests FdA as replacement

**NXcoordinate_system**
[1415](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1415) 

- SB: LP made the requested modifications, we could start online voting if the PR is fine in its current state
- AB: Yes, checking the modifications shows that the requested modification are now done. Let us start a vote on Thr, and now we ask for feedback until the vote starts.

**NXroot**
[1505](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1505) 

- As agreed, modifications have been implemented. The PR is merged.

**Optical Spectroscopy**
[1425](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1425)

- AB: Let us review it and resolve the conversations. Do the same as with coordinate systems: ask for feedback and then put it on vote on Thr together with NXcoordinate_system.

**MPES**
[1424](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1424)

- FS checked and happy with LP's modifications
- AB: Let us review it and resolve the conversations. Peter needs to resolve a conversation, and we should check the use of "@target" attribute. Attribute "@variant" could be used to label data copying, origin tracking, and descriptive notation.
- LP: "@target" in NXdata is reusing the attribute from LinkType, but explained it here, to make its use clear
- ZM: one may even need "@targets" (e.g. when a virtual dataset is used as being composed from multiple sources)
- HB: overdefinition (and multiple definitions of the same thing) makes it difficult to use them
- AB: can we reuse target as it is defined for links?
- SB: Yes. Actually, we could define "@target" for any fields, just like it is done for LinkType.
- HB: try to make the vocabulary simple as easy to comprehend.
- AB: Let us do the simplification in nxdl.xsd. Let us do the same as with optical spectroscopy and start the vote on Thr.

**EM**
[1423](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1423)

- MK: Let us check which concept should be moved to a separate base class, because NXobjects are used here to support collections.
- AB: Are only groups used inside NXobject-s, and no fields and attributes? We may want to make a specific base class for this purpose, e.g. NXbucket.
- PM: something like NXbag would do that, but partial name should be used here to avoid ambiguity.
- MK: What is different between NXbag and NXobject?
- AB: NXobject may be confusing, because it is too generic, but might actually also be able to serve as a bucket. Let us check what the best solution could be:
  - 1 : use NXobject as bucket (but asa convention use partial nameType with fixed prefixes to avoid ambiguity)
  - 2 : make a new base class, e.g. NXbag for this purpose
  - 3 : avoid such buckets and make (and use) special base classes for this pupose
