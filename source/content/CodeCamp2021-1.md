NeXus Code Camp - March 2021
============================

The 2021-1 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for 2 days in March 2021:
March 22 (Monday) - 23 (Tuesday). It will be an online meeting, copying the format of the [2020 Code Camp 2](https://www.nexusformat.org/CodeCamp2020-2.html).
A follow-up session will be held at 14:00 UTC on March 29 (Monday) in order to finish discussions.


## Purpose

The Code Camp is intended to be both an open help session for people to ask detailed questions and request specific help from core NeXus developers (e.g. writing an application definition or writing a NeXus file correctly) and to focus on developing the NeXus documentation and code.

If you have a topic you wish to discuss in the code camp, please mention it in a comment to this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues/82). 

NeXus periodically convenes a Code Camp to
develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small groups
working on specific projects and tasks. Most of those
attending the Code Camp session will already have a strong foundation
and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during the
event. If you don't feel confident in your current level of knowledge about
NeXus, you can contribute by reading the documentation and pointing out errors
and inconsistencies while you are learning. Contributing new or improved images 
for the documentation is also helpful.

(For more info on code camps, try searching Google for “code camp” or
“codeathon”. Events such as the [EPICS
Codeathon](https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php) would be
reasonable templates for this NeXus code camp.)
