* PRs  
  [1396](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1396) - NXdata  
  SB: left comments
  
  [1521](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1521) - Open Enumeration  
  AB: ready for vote
  
  [1528](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1528) - NXpid  
  SB: BW made suggestions for improvments
  AB: ready for vote

  [1408](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1408) - NXbeam  
  AB: NXcomponent is separated, ready for vote  
  
  [1525](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1525) - NXcomponent  
  AB: NXbeam - Is not it a component?  
  SB/PC: It is a characterisation at a certain location.  
  Majority of Telco participants agreed to consider it not be be a component for now.  
  AB: How to handle documentation if it is inhertied? Is it good not to render inherited information?  
  HB: No, it is better to provide a flat and complete documentation  
  SB: Agree, and it can be done as a separate task, but NeXus documentation building does not do that now.  
  PM: javadoc mentiones all inherited, but details only new things  
  BW: same with python docs in general  
  AB: let us make a new task for implementing this extended rendering of documentation.  
  AB: NXcircuit, shall be removed from here.  
  RO: NXobject PR#1507 is also bringing new items as inherited ones to these classes. Hence, those could be omitted, too. These 2 PRs chould go hand in hand.  
  AB: Let us add MinOccurs=0 to specify expicitly the optionality.
  AB: let us vote on it.

  [1507](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1507) - NXobject  
  AB: after the fixes, it can go for voting

  [1519](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1519) - NXlens_em  
  AB: changes are required according to new NXcomponent  
  MK: only NXxraylens exists. We can either make a new common super class and inherit from that one, or make new concepts.  
  BW: not much of overlap between different types.  
  PC: copyright dates needs to be fixed.  
  AB: 'value' is not too specific, we could use lens_excitation  
  BW: 'power_setting' is better.
  MK: It is fine.
  AB: Let us then implement it, and vote for it.

  [1410](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1410) - @target in NXdata  
  RO: This is supported as described by LinkType  
  SB: If this can be used for any FieldType, it shall be just made clear in documentation.  
  HB: hdf5 allows new constructs, but nexus definitions must be clear  
  PC: 'target' is also used at Diamond to specify where data is coming from.  
  AB: Problem is registered in the PR. NIAC shall resolved.

  [1419](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1419) - NXinstrument  
  LP: Already approved in Grenoble, it is just updated to follow the other approved changes.  
  AB: It is reviewed already. After a final read (by PC), it could be merged.

  [1413](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1413) - NXsample and sample_component  
  AB: 'physical_form' could be an enumeration.  
  LP: open enumeration can be a solution when it will be available.  
  PM: there are some plans at HZB for sample description which could be also checked out.  
  AB: update to align with the new form of NXcomponent. After that it can also be moved to a vote.
