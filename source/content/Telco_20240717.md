Minutes

* NIAC meeting  
Registration deadline for In person participation: Aug 5

* non-FAIRmat contributions  
  - AB: spin-rotator comes as a package with lots of base classes  
    no ISIS representations

* PR #1343 - NXdata scaling_factor and offset
  - AB: used at SACLA where float data is represented with a factor 10
  - RO: what is not it an attribute
  - BW: there is a problem with handling attributes when using external links to a dataset
  - AB: let us be able to define separate scaling factors for different fields, so instead of scaling_factor let us use FIELDNAME_scaling_factor
  - RO: scaling_factor was originally used in NXlog
  - BW: if we rename something, let us first DEPRECATE the old standard (scaling_factor in this case) and introduce the new solution
  - RO: is deprecation retrieveable from the xml?
  - AB: yes there is an xml tag ‘deprecated=‘

* NeXus logo https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues/145 
  - PM: is there a logo with vector graphics and transparency?
  - AB: we would need a high-resolution, svg, transparency supported logo, but no new logo shall be created
  - RO: old logo was done in bitmap mode
  - PM: shall be able to be converted to svg
  - BW: there is an svg version already (communications/NeXus_logo.svg)
    https://github.com/nexusformat/communications/blob/9c6def935cb083fa0a0a7077fb40a06c5e6ac8f9/NeXusLogo.svg 
  - RO: yes, but it comes with an unwanted border effect around the characters
  - BW: we shall also use consistently the official logo in different web pages. volunteered to prepare the material for a vote on how to clean the situation

* NXdata/@axes PR#1396
  - WdN: misinterpretation is now corrected in the PR. Note that documentation is also estructured for more clarity.
  - RO: note that length of AXISNAME field can be longer than the respective signal dimension by 1 because of  using ToF detectors at neutron sources
  - RO: also note that AXISNAME_indices if given for axes listed in @axes, they shall match the order in @axes
  - BW: in case of contradiction, an error shall be risen
  - RO: consistent use of terms axis, coordinate, and dimension is needed
  - AB: documentation needs to be easy to read
  - WdN: let me prepare a new proposal for the next meeting
    https://www.nexusformat.org/2014_axes_and_uncertainties.html 

* FAIRmat proposals
  - AB: lets prepare PRs for: 
    - common base classes
    - packages for separate appdefs and corresponding base classes
  - SB: exactly, topics are already organised on the Project page
    https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/5/views/1 
  - AB: on the Aug meeting, let us allocate 
    - 20 mins for NXdata
    - 70 mins for FAIRmat proposals
