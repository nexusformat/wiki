 * FS: questions on NXxas
   documentation is not clear on what is what. e.g. incoming_beam/data  
   SB: there is a NXxas workgroup, please join this effort on making this AppDef better  
   AB: also open  a corresponding issue, so we can track progress  

* PRs under vote:  
[1408](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1408)   
[1486](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1486)   

* PRs  
[1507](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1507)  - ready for merge  
  AB: accepted, get merged  
[1410](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1410)  - for Vote  
  AB: documentation should be made more clear  
  BW: do we need such attribute for the group itself?  
  AB: it requires a vote, let us put it up for it after the suggested changes are implemented.    
[1414](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1414)  - only Review needed  
  AB: After removing the not yet reviewed class, it contains now only proposal which has already been reviewed. 
  As it has been voted and accepted, after fixing the requested changes, it can be merged in.   
  AB: SB could open a new issue on updating the original and potentially outdated documentation of NXenvironment to be more clear.  
[1419](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1419)  - only Review is needed  
  After 1486, this can be also merged.  
[1420](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1420)  - only Review is needed  
  AB: has already been voted. Restructuring was asked to use inheritance. PR depends on PRs in vote.  
  LP: we can remove NXcalibration from here and then it can be merged immediate after review.  
  AB: NXregistration shall also subclass NXprocess. This needs to be addressed first, and then merge is possible.  
[1522](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1522)  - further discussion needed  
  LP: PR needs to be updated  
[1519](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1519)  - further discussion needed  
  AB: We could make NXcomponent a superclass of lots of instrument components. This can be addressed in a separate PR.  
  HB: NXcomponent properties could be part of NXobject  
  AB: Alternative: keep NXlens_em separate from NXcomponent if it shall be merged before making a decision on NXcomponent.
