### Dectris Eiger Streaming Format

Andreas got up early in the US weat coast and fought admirably against a
poor network link in order to provide us with an overview of the Eiger
image streaming format. Information can be found here:
<https://www.dectris.com/eiger.html> This all looks good and allows good
integration of a detector into local infrastructure. The main worry was
that people could write the flat format to file and call this “NeXus
light”. That will be addressed in the documentation.

### Github Issues

-   NXroot: <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/466>
    simple to fix, assigned
-   Missing symbols: <https://github.com/nexusformat/code/issues/414>
    still not understood, but reverted to a state that should have been
    working, awaiting tests
-   variable length strings:
    <https://github.com/nexusformat/code/issues/329> is an important
    issue, but ugly to implement, hence not many volunteers, assigned to
    Mark K thankfully.

### The New Landing Page Project (TNLPP)

Some progress, but no demoable prototype. Ray will update at the Telco
after the next

### Competing standard

Compiled a rough list of imgCIF, CXI, Data Exchange, TIFF, EDF, plus
things that are worse and more loosely defined.

This was to list them in a overview slide in a presentation on NeXus.

### Research Projects

Dropped due to lack of time. Will attempt next time.

### Next Meeting

Is [Telco 20160510](Telco_20160510.html "wikilink")

### AOB

None. (Out of time.)
