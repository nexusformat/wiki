Minutes
-------

Present  
EW, HJB, FA, MB, MK, PJ, TR, Stefan Brandstaetter

<!-- -->

Dectris  
Good progress made. Herbert will gather the remaining change requests in
a document and forward to Dectris. We will see an updated file in the
near future after that.

Herbert also to propose specification for exact location of detector
origin (tentative: centre of first pixel). This could be done in the
documentation for the *depends\_pn* in NXdetector.

<!-- -->

RDA  
No one going now. Might not be worth it for the moment.

<!-- -->

NAPI release  
EW and FA will have teleconference to investigate (procedure in general
and cmake in particular) and report at next meeting.

<!-- -->

Definitions versions  
There is some confusion about what NAPI writes out as NeXus\_version as
root attribute, how definitions release versions integrate with NAPI
releases (or don't) and how to have backward compatibility when using
versions on individual definitions. Further investigations on the best
route forward required. Ticket opened.

<!-- -->

AOB  
EW offers to try and organise a code camp in Hamburg either end of Oct
or end of Nov. The latter was preferred as Oct clashes with ICALEPCS

Next meeting: [Telco 20150218](Telco_20150218.html "wikilink") Invites sent out to nexus-tech, Hangout URL will stay the same
