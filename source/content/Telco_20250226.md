**accepted PRs**

- [1408](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1408) 
- [1519](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1519)
- [1528](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1528)

  - AB: Let us merge after the 2 weeks period has passed

**Wiki**
[PR](https://github.com/nexusformat/wiki/pull/14)

- RB: issue conversion is still a question

- RB: Some of links do not exists

- AB: General Content -> Site Map; let us wait for the OK from PC and then merge it

- SB: wiki is still being updated, please update the PR with the latest state and after its merge I can start using the new system (online [rst editing](https://rsted.info.ucl.ac.be/))

- RB: Perfect!

**NXdata**
[PR](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1396)

- SB: all possible axes should be listed under @axes
- WdN: No, actually, @axes are the default axes for each dimension. Additionally axes, must be registered under AXISNAME_indices
- SB: thanks, resolved!
- BW: NXdata was mostly commented from data writing perspective, but now the focus is reading NXdata. Hence, flow diagram for interpreting NXdata could be useful.
- SB: should also be compatible with the current description of the v3 convention of how to find and interpret default plotable
- WdN: yes, a flow diagram can actually be useful. Let us do it in a separate issue
- WdN: this PR is fixing bugs and improves documentation. It is ready for being merged
- AB: let us start a vote on it.

**FAIRmat PRs**

- [1415](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1415) 

  - WdN: more time is needed
 
- [MPES - 1424](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1424) 

  - AB: Shall #1410 be still resolved? If "reference" is renamed to "target" in NXmpes, we can use the existing functionality (of link\@target which needs to be better documented), and so NXmpes can be discussed without #1410
  - AB: how to review these PRs? typographic; technical; scientific? First 2 is OK, but point 3 is difficult.
  - MK: new communities (and tech partners) could also delegate people to NIAC in the longer run
  - HB: NIAC needs to work in modules. Small group of people shall be responsible for each scientific group
  - BW: NIAC can help to make things correct, but further improvements can also be done later.
  - AB: alternatives: (a) provide 1, 2, but skip 3. (b) invite external reviewers.
  - SB: FAIRmat has worked together with external collaborators on reviewing the scientific content.
  - AB: Let us focus on point 1,2. After cleaning the PRs (updates after incorporating accepted PRs), NIAC members could be assigned to individual PRs. Scientific community engagement could be done via writing papers for each topic.
  - MK: Also NIAC members could be involved, and we could have also a common publication on NeXus' evolution.
  - AB: Big paper could be good, but one paper for each community in targeted journal would also be needed, like the Golden standard for MX has been published in Acta Cryst D.
  - HB: also preprints shall be used volunteers for reviewing: PC, FS
