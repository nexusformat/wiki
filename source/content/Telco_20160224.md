### ECM 30 Workshop

MK can go, participants need to email HJB for seats

### Landing Page

Discussions took place, more progress expected next time

### Github issues

#### 448 (PR)

[Changes](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/447) to
application definitions require individual approval. This will not be
merged as a whole, but is a useful reference for future updates to these
definitions.

#### 443

Is a dramatic improvement to the manual and should be merged to master
as is so more eyes can provide feedback.

### AOB

Clarified that NXdata is currently required for a valid NeXus file.
There was 50:50 general agreement whether that this is necessary.
