    we include the FAQ page?
-   Is there documentation that is uniquely offline or online? This will
    become clearer with the mapping in the previous item

    UML and/or table version?
-   html to DocBook transform post processing - are these steps
    acceptable?
    -   documentation transformed from mediawiki to DocBook, edited
