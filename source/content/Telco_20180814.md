Present: TSR, MK, AB

## NIAC 2018

The small congregation in this telco opted for having a NIAC on October 18 & 19 (Thursday and Friday before NOBUGS). TSR will ask SIC if that can be arranged. No code camp.

## AOB

AB met someone at the latest Gordon Conference, doing Eiger work.
Two use cases where unclear:
Serial crystallography via a raster scan of a plate with multiple crystals and
scans with a limited amount of fixed angles, say 0, 45, 90 degree.
MK said that both should be well supported via NXtransformation scans, especially when
the raster scan does not need to define multiple distinguished samples.
AB will check this out.
