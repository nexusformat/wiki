----------------------------------------------------

NeXus for Java is an API which provides access to NeXus data files to
programs written in the programming language Java. This API was
implemented by Java code calling the original C language NeXus API
through the Java Native Methods Interface.

### Documentation

The following documentation is browsable online:

1.  The [NeXus for Java API](japinotes.html "wikilink") general instructions
    including installation notes, instructions for running NeXus for
    Java programs and a brief introduction to the API.
2.  The [Source](https://github.com/nexusformat/code/tree/master/bindings/java/)
    documentation
3.  A verbose tutorial for the NeXus for Java API.
4.  The API Reference.
5.  Finally, the source code for the test driver for the API which also
    serves as a documented usage example.

### Acknowledgement

All the code for number type conversion has been taken from the Java HDF
Interface library provided by NCSA. JHI also served as an inspiration
for many aspects of this API. See NCSA's copyright statement for more
