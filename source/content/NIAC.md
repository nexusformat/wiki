Constitution
------------

### Terms of Reference

The purpose of the NeXus International Advisory Committee is to
supervise the development and maintenance of the NeXus common data
format for neutron, x-ray, and muon science. This purpose includes, but
is not limited to, the following activities.

1.  To establish policies concerning the definition, use, and promotion
    of the NeXus format.
2.  To ensure that the specification of the NeXus format is sufficiently
    complete and clear for its use in the exchange and archival of
    neutron, x-ray, and muon data.
3.  To receive and examine all proposed amendments and extensions to the
    NeXus format. In particular, to ratify proposed application
    definitions and base classes, to ensure that the data structures
    conform to the basic NeXus specification, and to ensure that the
    definitions of data items are clear and unambiguous and conform to
    accepted scientific usage.
4.  To ensure that documentation of the NeXus format is sufficient,
    current, and available to potential users both on the internet and
    in other forms.
5.  To coordinate with the developers of the NeXus Application
    Programming Interface to ensure that it supports the use of the
    NeXus format in the neutron, x-ray, and muon communities, and to
    promote other software development that will benefit users of the
    NeXus format.
6.  To coordinate with other organizations that maintain and develop
    related data formats to ensure maximum compatibility.

The committee will meet at least once every calendar year according to
the following plan:

-   In years coinciding with the NOBUGS series of conferences (once
    every two years), members of the entire NIAC will meet as a
    satellite meeting to NOBUGS, along with interested members of the
    community.
-   In intervening years, the executive officers of the NIAC will
    attend, along with interested members of the NIAC. This is intended
    to be a working meeting with a small group.

### Membership

The NeXus International Advisory Committee will seek balanced
representation of the international community. It will consist of at
most one voting representative from each major neutron, synchrotron
x-ray, and muon facility. Membership would normally be for a three year
renewable term. Members will be nominated by each facility through the
facility director and approved by the existing committee. Each member
can appoint a substitute to attend a particular meeting.

The committee reserves the right to appoint additional members for a
limited period to ensure balanced representation.

### Organization

Accountability: The NeXus International Advisory Committee will ensure that their decisions are reported both on the NeXus web site and on the NeXus mailing list. Committee business will be conducted either through a mailing list, to which non-committee members can subscribe and whose archive will be available on the web, or through meetings, which will be advertised on the NeXus mailing list and which non-committee members may attend.  
The NeXus International Advisory Committee will have the following
executive officers:

-   Chair to oversee committee deliberations
-   Executive Secretary to coordinate meetings and online debates. The
    person that holds the position does not need to be an existing
    member of the NIAC, and does not vote unless he/she is a regular
    member.
-   Technical Manager with the responsibility to oversee the NeXus API.
    The tasks of the manager are to coordinate tests, manage and
    announce releases, and promote code from the contributed directory
    to the regular release build. The person that holds the position
    does not need to be an existing member of the NIAC, and does not
    vote unless he/she is a regular member.
-   Definition Release Manager with the responsibility to oversee the
    release of NeXus definitions and documentation. The person that
    holds the position does not need to be an existing member of the
    NIAC, and does not vote unless he/she is a regular member.

All of these officers will be elected for a two year term. The incumbent
chair and executive secretary are limited to two consecutive terms.

Voting: Only members of the NeXus International Advisory Committee will 
be able to vote on specific proposals that come under the remit of the 
committee. However, all debates will be conducted publicly and 
non-committee members are both allowed and encouraged to participate.  

Topics voted on at the biennial NIAC meetings will require a simple majority unless specifically
challenged by a committee member. In the event of a challenge, the issue
will be presented to the NeXus mailing list inviting comments for a
period of one month. At the end of this period, the challenge can be
overruled by a two thirds majority.

Voting outside of the biennial NIAC meetings can take two forms.
Firstly, memberships can be approved by email ballot. All other issues
require a vote that receives responses from at least 2/3 of the NIAC
during the following two week voting period. The opening of the
voting period must be advertised through the NIAC mailing list. At the
close of the voting period, NIAC members who have not responded have
abstained (and are not counted towards the 2/3 requirement). Whether the
issue involved is membership or any other issue, the NIAC decision shall
be determined by whatever outcome receives the most votes that are not
abstentions, i.e. the outcome which receives more votes than any other
outcome other than abstention, even if the chosen outcome does not
receive an absolute majority of the votes.


The constitution can only be changed by a two thirds majority of the
NIAC.

Special Interest Groups: The NeXus International Advisory Committee will appoint editors to be in charge of particular groups that wish to specify instrument definitions or develop specialized uses of the NeXus format. The groups will establish their own mode of operation, but will be expected to consult widely with the community relevant to their work, and to refer back to the NeXus International Advisory Committee any matters that involve a change in the current NeXus specification. Specific proposals produced by these groups will be presented to the NeXus International Advisory Committee for comment and formal ratification.

Sub-Committees
--------------

The former NeXus Technical sub-committee
that used to host regular teleconference meetings
has been retired.
In the interest of being inclusive and approachable
the sessions are now open to all interested parties.
See the [Teleconferences](Teleconferences.html "wikilink") page for agendas, minutes, and how to join.
