    application definition have to be defined in a base class? Question
    from DLS.

Minutes
-------

Present: MK, HJB, MB, PJ, TSR

HJB suggests recording these sessions via Hangout On Air. We'll think
about it.

Detector axes: Some progress made on ideas, but no example yet. TSR to
report again next time.

Completeness of base classes: After some discussion the agreement is
that application definitions have a higher value than base classes. Base
classes capture the common cases and should not have to carry every
domain specific field that might ever come up. There also is the
procedural problem that proposing a new application definition might
require a base class change first, if that was enforced by software
(which would be the case for the code DLS is developing). Encoding this
addition explicitly via some tag was rejected. Once application
definition can add fields that changes the framework and matching the
names to see what needs to be added is simple for software. TSR to
contact Peter Chang and edit the manual where PC was mislead.

Technical problems and other commitments cut the meeting short. Next one
is [Telco 20150909](Telco_20150909.html "wikilink")
