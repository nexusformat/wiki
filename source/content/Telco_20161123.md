Minutes
-------

Present: MK, HJB, EW, AF, AB, PJ, RO

### Minutes from NIAC

Generally accepted with minor corrections. All action items should be
understood and covered in tickets or already done.

Versioning is ongoing with good progress. A lot of the workflow will
smooth out overtime and become clearer with use, we hope.

### Github issues

Pull request accepted with minor changes.

NXDL contact attribute idea was rejected as detracting from proper
forums like mailing lists and NIAC.

Unused attributes: ref and refindex seem to be unused indeed. They
should be deprecated now. (and exercise in versioning as well.)

### pixels as length

Not a great idea, but follows current practice at experiments. Should be
accepted. Will figure out a way to allow that and what the proper unit
name for pixels is.

### Postponed Items

We ran out of time on:

-   web site redesign - future of wiki
-   Can we rename the `uncertainties` attribute (such as in NXdata) to
    be the singular `uncertainty`?

They have been put on the next meetings' agenda with some other items
that came up.
