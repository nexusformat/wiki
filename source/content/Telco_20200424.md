Agenda
------
   * [Issue #748: Mixed use of NXreflections and NXmx telco](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/748)
   * [Issue #765: NXcanSAS "radiation" duplicates NXsource "type"](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/765)
   * [Issue #762: [NXtomo] Need user flags](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/762)

Minutes
-------
Present: BW, AB, FA, HG, HB, MK, PJ, PC

NIAC
-----
   * NOBUGS registration is split into separate days for the code camp
   * linking not yet
   * spacing for SD is fine
   * need to make sure teleconferencing is adequate


Pull Request #767
-----------------
   * AB notes [PR #767](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/767) is ready for final review.
   * PJ notes that travis-ci reports a failure (reST syntax encoded within XML).

Issue #748
----------
   * NXreflections describes diffraction spots in a tabular format, having evolved from historical practice of attributing and recording diffraction spots from film-based photographs.
   * it is a base class and not an appdef (currently)
   * Both versions (base class and AppDef) have use cases.
   * An Appdef should be written that has NXreflections as a major component so that it can be used together with NXmx
AB brings up related Pull Request #767

Issue #765
----------
   * best to mark radiation as deprecated
   * PJ to discuss with canSAS people
   
Issue #762
----------
   * user def keys should be negative
   * extra (or subgroup of fields) fields (NXnotes) needed to describe user def keys  
      * Need stadardised name for description
   * any new positive key should be NIAC approved
   
AB asks MK: base classes can't be a subentry?
   * subentries must be AppDef
   * entries can also be AppDef
   
Issue #757
----------
   * HB suggests doing what the PDB community does and have a list of registered prefixes
   * starting with an underscore didn't work out for PDB
   * NIAC should grant power for approving prefix registration
   * BW suggests prefixes be in uppercase to make them obvious to human readers
   * PJ suggests prefixes be followed by an underscore
   * PJ will post new issue with proposal for the NIAC


Any Other Business
---------------------

   * PC asks NXuser for a group of users
      * MK suggests using multiple instances of NXuser
   * PC ask: is there a way to give numerical precision?
      * should be applicable to any general field
      * Outside of current scope - someone needs to propose a method - perhaps as an attribute
   * HG asks: How has NeXus been approaching ontologies and mapping metadata betwen formats
      * NeXus predates much of the current academic interest in ontologies
      * PJ suggests talking to a group at the ALS
      * PJ asks if there is a general Ontology that NeXus can fit within
       * HG says that ontologies tend to sit next to each other as peers, rather than under an umbrella ontology
   * PJ points to the index of the NeXus definitions as a starting point to mapping the NeXus ontology
     * HG will create new GitHub issue for a published NeXus ontology
     * PJ proposed using information from the manual's index as a starting point
     * PJ noted that various items of NeXus structure (group, field, attribute) are automatically indexed
     * MK noted that position in hierarchy is important since some terms (such as `name`) have multiple meanings
     * ontology should include
       * [NeXus class path](https://manual.nexusformat.org/design.html#index-15) to specify hierachy position
       * documentation content from the NXDL for each item listed
    
 Next telco: Mid May, using a poll in the same manner as previously.
