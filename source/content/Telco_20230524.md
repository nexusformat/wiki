* https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1262  
AB: bit_depth of image as metadat to be added  
HB: proposal in 2012 for adding all datatype info as metadata (not only as hdf property)  
PM: what to do if duplicated info (NeXus metadata vs. hdf metadata) has mismatch?  
AB: raise error  
BW: it was not a problem for long time, so if problem does not come, we could just use the system as it is now.  
NeXus as container agnostic solution, we could add.  
SB: let introduce it to the base class NXdetector  
AB: let us vote for it in June  
SB: if data type needs to be registered (signed, unsigned, big/little endin, 8/16/32/... bit etc.), also multi dimensional slow/fast axes needs to be specified. Do we suggest it for any Field, Attribute?  
AB: here we focus on NXdetector, where a single new property would be just enough for now.  

* https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1255  
SB: electron beam?  
PM: electron gun  
HB: kathode-ray tube  
BW: Electron Microscope should be just fine  
AB: SB is in charge to call for a meeting of the EM community before the CC in June.  

* https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1248  
Paulo: how can NXmx have SOURCE inside ENTRY if it NXentry does not allow if, but only INSTRUMENT which on the other hand does allow SOURCE  
SB: base classes only define optional elements, but Application definitions can extend them  
HB: structure shall not code information, but rather any information shall be on the same level.  
AB: actually soft-linking solves this problem. The same information can be referenced by both ENTRY/SOURCE and ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/SOURCE.
