Minutes

Present: HJB, PJ, AB (first 10 min), TSR

### NXspecdata

The idea is that eventually SPEC may write NeXus. Most fields are
mappings of what core macros write out. The usage of the files isn't
quite in alignment with NeXus traditions, for example with respect to
the relationships between files and NXentries. And there are other open
comments, but contributed definitions can be work in progress. Merged

### NIAC items

Recorded here: <https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues>

### Next Telco

[Telco 20160712](Telco_20160712.html "wikilink")

### AOB

Herbert mentions this web site on HDR MX <http://hdrmx.medsbio.org/>

PJ brings the next wording on the base classes to our attention. We all
agree, but find actually developing a base class has implications on the
technical infrastructure. Ticket in NIAC opened. Also: The search on the
manual pages is not as useful as it could be.
