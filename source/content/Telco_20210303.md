Present

MK, FA, PC, WG, BW, SB, AB, MO, HB, PJ, RB, BC

Minutes
--------

Technology options for the code camp were discussed, such as Github Discussion, Slack, zoom channels. Zoom channels looked like they may be worth a go. We could just keep all details on issues, but this may get a bit cluttered. Action on FA to set up some technology options to try. It was agreed that having the issues on a GitHub project worked well last time.  

The date of the code camp was fixed for 22nd March, taking place on Monday and Tuesday with a sum up session on Monday 29th

Thank you to PJ for renaming GitHub master -> main in our repositories

BW raised the issue of packaging as he had been looking at anaconda and conda-forge. PJ commented that conda-forge was better than pip at resolving dependencies and managing binaries, and it was used by [BlueSky](https://nsls-ii.github.io/bluesky/). He recommended making your own conda channel first. WG shared a link showing Conda is also more general than [just python](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/compiler-tools.html). It was suggested that having cnxalidate on conda would be useful - maybe a code camp task? nexpy is [already available on conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/nexpy) and punx is on the [nsls2 forge](https://anaconda.org/nsls2forge/punx). WG shared a link to the [Spack](https://spack.io/) package manager that has been used at ORNL.

PJ mentioned a question he had been asked regarding recording processing details from EPICS area detector plugins in NeXus files. Choices were as an NXnote or NXprocess. It was agreed that for this case NXprocess was appropriate as the pluguns could provide sufficient details.
