Minutes

* Codecamp
Agreed period:  June 15-16 & 20-21, 2023

* XAS.  From Ray: "Your concerns do however suggest that we need to find a way to identify which category best describes a particular application definition, perhaps by providing some provenance information or defining a maintainer. I can only attend the first half hour tomorrow, but I believe this is something well worth discussing." https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1011
  * BW: XAS experiments are also using https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXstxm.html#nxstxm, but NXxas is not in a good shape
  * HG/PM: EXAFS would also be happy to build on top of NXxas
  * BW: flexible sample and detection systems are required,although the main structure is always similar
  * MN: EXAFS standards and dataformats exist on top of hdf5. NeXus is pushed but proper support is still needed.
  * RO: NX started with instrument and data collection description, but then AppDef arrived to define interface between data producer and consumer.
  * MN: EXAFS would need clear common definitions, like monochromator d spacing, etc. RAW data is nice to have, but calibrated is even more important. What can be stored in Nexus
  * SB: both, it depends on the community. See analogy with NXmonopd.
  * BW: we can use immediately base classes e.g. NXdetector
  * RO: multiple AppDef can de satisfied by a single file or an AppDef and other base classes
  * MN: What kind of definitions are supplied by NeXus?
  * BW: NXdetector is already for multi-dim detectors, and can be used (if needed also extended) Ideas can be taken from NXstxm.
  * AB: You can propose new definitions so we can review and vote on it.
  * RO: we could define maintainers for all AppDefs
  * AB: Great! Main (NIAC) contacts can be added to the 
  * MN: maybe IUcR representative?
  * PJ: technical contacts and follow how much the community is using the definitions.
  * PM: also data analysis developers could be in the loop.
  * AB: deprecation should be done VERY carefully. 
  * RO: APS and FAIR requirements with NeXus
  * BW: what is the timeline for XAS?
  * MN: do it right rather than quick.

* Get status on NXdata: improve documentation regarding axes https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1213
  * WdN: AXISNAME_INDICES  - is it a scalar or an array?
  * WdN: AXISNAME - what is its dimension should be? Is it 1D array or not?
  * RO: how to plot it?
  * WdN: ESRF implemented it with matplotlib
  * SB: use xarrays
    https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/examples/multidimensional-coords.html
  * TC: non-regular gidding shall be supported.
  * BW: recording must be supported. visualisation is secondary.  
    NXdata: data vs.plot?! (RO: data, but with a sensible look on it)
  * PJ: NXcanSAS: use of multi-dimensional axis array (e.g. at Diamond I22)
  * RO: **make a session on the code-camp**
  * AB: the PR could have a py plotting code included
