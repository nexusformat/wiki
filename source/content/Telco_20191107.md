Code Camp
------
   * PJ offered to host code camp at ANL either on December 11-13th, or January 2020.
      * It was agreed that Dec was too soon and difficult to arrange travel, so Jan 2020 would be better.
   * Some discussion of what work should be targeted to justify a code camp
      * PJ points out lots of issues on github to clean, especially for the [definitions release that is now overdue](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/8)
   * PJ asked where to publish details
      * BW has created a page on the wiki that can be viewed at <https://www.nexusformat.org/CodeCamp2020.html>
   * PJ will create poll to decide precise dates

Executive Secretary and Membership Renewal Voting
------------------

   * MB has left NeXus and resigned as executive secretary. This is an issue especially because we need to do quite a few membership votes which are normally handled by the executive secretary.
   * BW will handle voting for membership renewals, except for the vote on his own membership, which will be handled by RO.
   * Discussion of duties of executive secretary:
      * Run email voting
      * Take minutes of meetings, especially the full NIAC meetings
      * (BW currently takes minutes of telcos and can continue this)

Logo Drafts
----------

   * Some preference for the dark blue colour in version I and J
   * Need to include consideration of background colour
   * Need to consider a version with a square aspect ratio
   

Other Business
--------------
   * Some web pages still only http - need to move to https
      * For example, the [Manual](https://manual.nexusformat.org/user_manual.html)
   * Another telco in December - [poll](https://doodle.com/poll/zw28gkvx72348bs2)
