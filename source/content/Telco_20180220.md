Minutes
-------

Present: MB, MK, HJB, TSR

Relatively short meeting as some originally planned agenda items would have required RO or AB.

### Definitions Release

Closed a couple of issues and attempted to have most open ones assigned to a person now.

### Telco tagged Tickets

One had been discussed and the tag could be taken off. The other item was RO's proposed NXdata changes.

### Next Meeting
[Telco 20180313](Telco_20180313.html)

### AOB

Short heads up on this meeting: https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/events/scientific-data-management/index_en.html
As well as minor ones and upcoming grant proposals.
