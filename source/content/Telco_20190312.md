Present: BW, MK, HJB, TM, AB

## NeXus for FELs

AB reports that work has been progressing on implementing NeXus for single shot crystallography experiments at the European XFEL (and SwissFEL). While still a work-in-progress, the code has already had a first use in an experiment at the Europeean XFEL.
HJB commented on an issue that a requirement for an extra geometry file wasn't properly documented. AB noted that it is because of a shortcut (reusing existing code) that will be fixed soon.

## Dectris NeXus

HJB and AB continue to work on improving the NeXus output of Dectris detectors.

## Implementing NeXus at Spring8

TM reports that work is progressing at Spring8 for the implementation of NeXus at the beamlines.
