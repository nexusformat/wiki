  PC summarised and announced the new NeXus release 2024.02

* NIAC Meeting  
  WdN: NIAC meeting is in place, no problem with having access to the rooms on the week-end 
  - in person participation is indicated by 7 people from the call
  - 3 persons requested remote access
  - formal invitation letter is requested by US participants

* topics for the meeting  
  - SB: FAIRmat (standardisation of NXmpes, NXellipsometry…)
  - PM: Sample Environment workgroup SECoP@HMC, Liquid Reflectometry
  - WdN: NXstress (https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1039) for stress-strain analysis, and NXxas review (ongoing effort in XAS working group)
  - HG: NeXus Ontology (PR for v2 should use and reference the official NeXus repo)

* NXtransformations  
  - SB: extending NXtransformation to be able to cover more than just translation and rotation, e.g. a matrix for generic base change
  - HB: yes, we need a “general” transformation as it is called and supported in CIF. Note that it should also be open for more dimensions
  - MK: non-orthogonal axis can be defined using factors.

* NeXus Ontology  
  - PM: connection between NeXus and PaNet ontologies and to other ontologies is initiated at ESRF. Implementation uses rule based classification methods (e.g. if theta_max is smaller than xxx than it is SAX experiment)
  - SB: we also work on references to ISO standards and ontology terms, but only in doc strings yet. 
  - HG: PID could also be put somewhere
  - HB: reference-list should be added explicitly in definitions
  - SB: NXDL could be extended to be able to describe such reference list
