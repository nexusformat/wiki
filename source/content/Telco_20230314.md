* Passcode: nexus

Agenda
------
 * CodeCamp
 * issues

Present
-------

SB, AB, HB, HG, MK, PM, PJ, RO, RB, WdN

Minutes
-------

* Codecamp
Agreed period:  end of June, 2023

* General requirements for changing definitions:
    * modification in Base Classes or Application Definitions which affect reading and writing files: vote is needed
    * fixing documentation or bugs: PR and review is needed
anyone can issue a PR, but it is suggested to  
work in a small groups (with domain experts)


* AB: Topic suggested by Dectris - [PR #1246](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1246)  
NX_CHAR_OR_NUMBER to be used for NXdata/AXISNAME  
NX_CHAR_OR_NUMBER <union> NX_CHAR, NX_NUMBER  
    * MK: make labels separate from NUMBER typed AXISNAME,  
e.g. AXISNAME@index_labels(NX_CHAR): array of NX_CHAR labels  
    * RO: one shall demonstrate how to use it (e.g matplotlib)
    * SB: nxpy, H5web? - others plotting applications
    * AB/PJ: going with MK we do not break the standard
    * Conclusion: AB will be taking it back to Dectris for further discussion, to see if indirection is acceptable. 

* AB: [#940](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/940)  
threshold_1_channel(NXdetector_channel)
threshold_energy
is it generic enough?

* PM: [#1247](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1247)  
discussion deferred until next time.
  
* WdN [#1212](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1212)
WdN: presented ambiguities around the interpretation of NXdata/@AXISNAME_indices  
    * Use Case 1:  
axes=[[xp,xq],y,[z,time]] referreing to a 3D dataset  
where the 1st axis can be labeled by both xp, and xq, the second by y, and the 3rd by both z and time.
    * Use Case 2:  
axes=[x,y,z]  
x_indices=0,1 (x is a 2D array to specify x for each column along z)  
y_indices=0,1 (y is a 2D array...)  
from this one can do a 2D plot for each slice along z where the z values at (i,j) are ploted at the position (x(i,j),y(i,j)).  
    * Note that documentation says that the size of axes “must must” be the same as the rank of the signal array, which must be a bug.
    * MK: maybe axes could be an array of lists (as demonstrated above) to make it clear and then we do not even need AXISNAME_indices 
    * RO: these are around for a while, but is there anyone who are using them?
    * AB: proposal for Wout to take the discussion and make a PR that is what he thinks is the best approach.  We'll use that as a discussion point for next time.

* PM [#412](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/412)  
Documentation for NXdetector should be cleaned and updated
