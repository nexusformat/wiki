### Github Issue of the Day

The two issues itemised above are resolved by the general agreement on
being permissive with base classes. That is while base classes aim to
cover most use cases, they don't list all acceptable groups and fields.
In order to be able to progress the standard additional data is
acceptable. Validation tools should not treat such additional items not
covered by a base class as errors, but notes or warnings. Users should
encouraged to find the best defined location for their information, but
we understand there is not a defined place for all possible data.

This may require clarification in the manual.

Related to that: cnxvalidate currently does no validation for files that
do not (claim to) conform to an application definition. Just checking
the use of base classes is another important use case. MK opened a
ticket to investigate.

Issue 330 (definitions): Comments left on the ticket. Partial action
required at most. Could be resolved at the next NIAC.

### PUNX

PJ shared his latest python project:

It does similar things to cnxvalidate plus additional tooling.
