Minutes
-------
* NIAC 2024: Sep 27-30 with early starters from Sep 26.
* feedbacks on new online voting: looked OK and smooth
* Dectris PRs: both #1246, #1252 got voted
* FAIRmat: #1336, #1337 - looks good, after review could go in
  * #1271: 
    * PC: NXaperture_em may should be NXequipment_settings/apertture_em,…
    * AB: what about NXcollection? will not NXequipment_setting will be the same?
    * BW: indeed, one can put such settings to NXcollection
    * WdN: yes, but those settings are validated and are not connected to any NeXus concept 
    * SB: as a consequence they may easily be stored incoherently and become unsearchable
    * MK: AppDef shall not define always new stuff, but reference concepts defined in base classes.
    * AB: NXsettings is not supporting the idea of predefined concepts. NXaperture_em can and shall be used in AppDefs  
      value statements: 
      * less number of base classes
      * appdef shall speciaise base classes
      * common specialisation should go back to base classes
    * SB: in parctice it result in lots of copy-paste and artificial split of the same concepts, base class inheritance would solved that problem
    * AB: agreed
* bugs on contributor list in HTML pages: not all contributors listed
  * HB: if recent contributers are listed as contacts, it could be renamed
  * RB: new suggestion will come
* PR #1332: clarification on NXdata’s scaling_factor, also in #1333 its relationship with NXdata’s offset is in question
  * RO: an example: reciprocal angstrom is scaled to hkl
  * MK: NXprocess couls also host such data conversion, but data duplication may not be efficient
  * AB: problem is that the definition is ambigous (is it already applied or not)
  * RO: yes, ambiguity shall be resolved by cleaner definition
* Formar grammar and Math support in NeXus
  * HB: subcommittee would be needed to propose support for Math in NeXus
  * AB: formar grammar in contributed defintion shall be OK; further decision shall be made before it goes to AppDef/BaseClasses; subcommittee is to form: FD, BW, PC, HB and resolve the question by NIAC 2024
* release
  * AB: early jan 2024; quality metters
  * BW: NXaperture deprecation shall be carefully reviewed
