Minutes

**NXcoordinate_system**
[1415](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1415)
  
- HB: handedness may cause confusion (that of coordinate system vs. that of rotation)
- AB: documentation shall be clear about the relationship between NXtransformations and NXcooridnate_system
- WdN: depends_on field can be used generally
- MK: make it clear if a transformation is active (object is transformed in the space) or passive (the space is transformed in which the objects is described)
- AB: overall clarification is needed, like we had recently for NXdata (separate PR)
- AB: after making the requested changes on this PR, we set up a 1week review period, and then we can start an only vote. (all agreed)

**NXroot**

- MK: also the documentation (of 'extends') needs to be modified according
- AB: +1
- AB: after the modification can be merged (vote is not needed because it is just fixing a bug - all agreed)

**OptSpec**
[1425](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1425)

- HB: supported the PR
- WdN had no time to check it yet

**MPES**
[1424](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1424)
  
- PC reviewed and will check responses
- FS started to look into
- LP accepts the suggestions

**EM**
[1423](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1423)
  
- AB: Application definitions could be used to define a simple group (other than a specialisation of NXentry) which is reusable in other application definitions.
