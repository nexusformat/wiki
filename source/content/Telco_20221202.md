  January Telco will have a special session on XPCS whith the community also invited

* Documentation versioning [https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1228](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1228)  
  PJ:
    - it would be nice to select the release/version in the documentation
    - number of github commit steps after the release could be added
    - link to issue [https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1021](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1021)   

  AB: 
    a cleaner ID would be better than github commit  

  TC: 
    7 digit commit hash could be enough  

  RO: 
    everything commited is official  
  
  BW: 
    we should only consider only tagged releases being official  
  
  PJ: 
    releases normally after a codecamp and NIAC meeting, but can be done on request  
  
  AB: 
    We could do one now!  

  The consensus of the discussion is documented in the issues.

* Contributed definitions  
  AB: Would we need cleaning here? Proactivly, NIAC could reach out to authors of old definitions if the definitions should be promoted to be offical.  
  
  CZ: 
    A quick update on the file NXsnsevent.nxdl.xml: it is still being used by ISIS, HFIR, and SNS.  Please DO NOT remove/deprecate it. Pete, thanks for suggesting the ratification of this def file.  It would be great if we can move it to the application folder.  
    
  AB: issues should recored how and why and by whom contributed definitions are committed. See issue [https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1229](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/1229).
