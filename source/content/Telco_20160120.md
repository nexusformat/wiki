Minutes
-------

Present: EW, MK, AB (first half), Armando (second half), Ray Osborn,
HJB, TSR

#### Agenda

revised for the meeting

#### CSPAD

Herbert and Aaron are making some progress. Current files use absolute
paths for external links, that could be discouraged.

#### cnxvalidate

Has 50 tests passing and is ready for testing by friendly users. Tickets
to produce a validating tool are to be closed in code and definitions
repositories and cnxvalidate has it's own issue tracking.

#### issue of the day

-   resolved open question about NXtransformations
-   EW accepted pull request for trigger additions to NXdetector (plus
    related ticket)
-   closed call for validation tool

#### version numbers for classes

While there is version number on the class definition files this is not
used in the current infrastructure (and cannot easily be used). This
should be discussed at the next NIAC.

There was also a discussion about a process to make simple editorial
changes to classes or backward compatible additions. Consensus was that
formal criteria enforced by a tool (like three votes on the issue
tracker) would not be a good solution. For the moment we will do this by
consensus in the telco and via pull requests to be accepted by a second
person. Also to be discussed at the NIAC.

#### issues raised by Armando

There are two problems: subentries and NXdata.

NXdata appears to have some documentation problems which Ray will
confirm and raise a ticket for.

Subentries are compatible with what Armando wants. Ray will send a
summary of the discussion to the mailing list separately for a wider
audience.

#### Next meeting
