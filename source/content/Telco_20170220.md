## Minutes

Present: MK, MB, PJ, HJB, TSR, FAA, AB, RO

### Website
The Github Pages redesign was well received. Action on FAA and TSR to liaise on making this the replacement of the current wiki *and* main website.

### NXMX update
EW sent in his approval. TSR would prefer not to change non-NXMX application definitions, as they have not asked for a change. This will be dropped. MK had some issues with the new wording to be clearer about what kind of length are allowed. He will edit this and MB will merge the pull request.

### HDRMX meeting
[HDRMX event in Lund](https://indico.maxiv.lu.se/event/233/overview) - Herbert co-hosts, let him know if you want to join.

### RDA and similar events
Ray would like to see some NeXus participation at one of the following events:
* <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RDxpWLxzeOX1FknPHsu7ivnbPDAxOTSMOoCW7uPzG4c/edit#heading=h.5tid0eo8bky8>
* <https://indico.cells.es/indico/event/97/overview>

People will give it some good thought.

### AOB
* Unfortunately EW missed deadlines for inclusion of latest NAPI et al into Debian.
* AB has some interest by FEL people to potentially join the NIAC. They would be very welcome to join.
* MD may have some interest by an electron microscope vendor to join discussions. This is also very welcome. For the moment DLS can facilitate this. Partcipation in Telcos is open as well.
