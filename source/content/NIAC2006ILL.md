### Meeting layout

The format of the last meeting at Santa Fe was very productive, and so
similar break-out group meeting rooms are envisaged at this meeting.
Such groups might be

**technical programming the api**

'''instruments-1 3-axis/reflection/[SAS](SAS.html "wikilink")/polarised/muons
'''

-   (step-scanning/multi-detector/X-ray/neutron)
-   examples...
-   update definitions
-   prototype treated data

**instruments-2 TOF inelastic/TOF Powder diffraction**

-   (Principally multi-detector neutron instruments)
-   experts from completed instruments offer feedback to the remainder
-   example data
-   update definitions
-   prototype treated data 1D,2D data
-   rebinning, constant (Q,w)

**[Synchrotron\_Group] (Synchrotron_Group.html "wikilink") (Andy Götz)**

-   this group will meet separately on the second and third days, and
    may be expected to offer objective feedback and criticism on the
    NeXus project from their fresh point of view.

It will be possible, too, to find additional space if other specific
interest groups wish to meet separately.

We should designate a publication sub-committee to write a report for
Synchrotron Radiation News and Neutron News

The problem of regular finance of NIAC activities has been posed to the
ILL directors, and one is invited to the opening of the meeting.
