Minutes

- NIAC 2024
During the meeting, ensure people that are remote are notified that a vote is coming.  Need time for offline people to digest proposals before votes.  
Use plenary vs working sessions, multiple of each per day
- NeXus front page says next meeting is code camp 2023
- Reviewed schema bugfixes in https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/1370
  - PM: sidestep by setting up a different way of specifying examples (nxdl namespace for example).
  - PJ: this is about how to provide examples of unit types in the nexus schema.  Each unit type needs an example to avoid confusionRevisit discussion of general 
- NXtransformations
  - AB: NXtransformations that are rotations are full basis transformations: rotation + the vector offsetHJB: non-problem, as transformation type can be omitted, for "general" basis definitions like gravity
  - PM: is there an example with the current NXtransformations are insufficient?
- PM: upcoming EU funding may be available from a broad project that includes photons/neutrons.
  - There are open calls for 1-2 year projects, 1 FTE.  
  - We could apply for some funding to update toolage.  
  - Call in spring (opens this friday) and sept.
  - AB: remember what the NIAC is: specs, docs/examples/validator.  Maybe validator help would be useful?
  - MK: cnxvalidate could use an update?  Should we have a reimplementation in python?
  - AB: Touch base with Ray for some NeXpy support?
  - PM: will think and maybe bring a proposal back
  - HB: include h5py if working on NeXpy
  - PM: looking for a library that exposes base class as python types
  - PJ: punx has this (AB to what extent?): https://github.com/prjemian/punx
  - RB: has a nxstixm file validator: https://github.com/RussBerg/nxstxm_validator
  - RB: has code for autogenerating NeXus files
