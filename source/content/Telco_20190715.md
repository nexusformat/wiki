Agenda

   * 2019 NeXus Code Camp
   * HDF5 European Workshop for Science and Industry (ESRF 17-18 September)

Minutes
------

Present: BW, MK, HB, AB


HDF5 Workshop
------
   * BW to attend and represent NeXus.
   * HB has been seeing many bugs when trying to run the .10 version in high-performance situations. Detectors like the Eiger need a parallel file system (e.g. GPFS) to keep up with the data rate, but the HDF5 library has not been very stable.
      * We should ask the HDF group to please stabilise the HDF5_1.10 library on parallel file systems.
      * Perhaps we can help organise facilities to combine efforts?

NeXus Code Camp
-------
   * MB to talk to David Hall about code camp dates
      * Brexit issues (visas for EU citizens)
      * Check dates
      
      
Other Business
--------
   * MK asks HB about how NXmx has been viewed by the community. HB replies that NXmx is a success with ongoing collaborations and millions of images recorded using NXmx.
   
   * MB to leave Diamond in December and step down as NeXus Executive Secretary.
      * Asks for feedback on recent pull request.
      * BW asked MB to prod Mark Herron regarding discussions about EU projects.
