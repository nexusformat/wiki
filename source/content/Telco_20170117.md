Minutes

Present: TSR, RO, MK, PJ

Pull requests accepted and closed.

Ticket opened for clarifying status of “anonymous” groups (without a
specific required name) in the documentation. That is currently rendered
as “(name)” without the qoutes, which is not obvious.

Examples for uncertainties: Well received, except for the units 1/A for
1/Angstroms, which will require further discussions. We will need to
update the documentation and NXDL to formally allow uncertainties.

AOB: Ray suggests we are present at the RDA meeting and
remote-data-pre-meeting in Barcelona in April. He will provide links via
mail. “LInks to RDA” set on the agenda for next time.
