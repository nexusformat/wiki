Minutes
-------

-   nexus-tech now open for subscripts, calendar invites will be send
    there
-   hangout link should keep working permanently, so there is no need to
    generate a new one every time
-   a sufficient number of people is administrator on the wiki and can
    create accounts from the special pages
-   jenkins is building definitions only and publishes to the web site,
    it lives at <http://build.nexusformat.org> The aim is to have it set
    up so that github groups can be used to set up user accounts and
    permissions
-   release by summer would be good, maybe without cmake for Linux. Will
    be investigated by Freddie and Eugen
-   Tobias volunteered to generate tickets of all action items from the
    NIAC meeting in github
-   Logo: Tobias does not like purple and is not keen on the existing
    font. Mark K would like to keep the existing logo as ported to SVG
    by Ben. Pete J finds none of the proposed alternatives sufficiently
    different to justify a change. Most like the idea to turn the u in
    NeXus into a mu.
-   features: not significant progress for discussion
-   detector vendors: all to submit contact details, Tobias to publish
    draft for next telco
-   next meeting will be [Telco 20150203](Telco_20150203.html "wikilink")
-   NoOB
