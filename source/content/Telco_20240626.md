AB, SB, HB, RB, WdN, FS, PC, BW, HG, LG, BB, PM, TM + Arnold Paecklar (ILL)

Minutes
-------
- NXstress for stress and strain analysis
  - WdN: proposal to accept it as contributed
  - WdN: for hotel bookings https://indico.esrf.fr/event/114/page/38-practical-information
  - AB: ambiguity with having multiple NXnotes shall be guaranteed
  - SB: CALIBRATION(NXnote) and notes(NXnote) are OK, only a data item called “notes” will be assigned to  “notes”, and all other data objects named differently will be assigned to CALIBRATION and can have calibration_type also attached.
  - BW: calibration_type could be enumeration or examples in doc string

- NIAC2024
  - AB: schedule for sessions is prepared

* NXdata
  - PC: issue #1381 NXdata/AXES can now have multiple axes assigned to the same dimension. Is it OK?
  - SB: note that also the order of items in @axes was linked to the dimensions of the DATA.
    @AXISNAME_indices are now defining which axes belong to which dimensions.
  - PC: we could keep restricting @axes to list the default axes for the DATA, and alternative axes could be collected from @AXISNAME_indices
  - AB: let us make a PR so it can be reviewed.

* standardisation of contributed definitions
  - Projects
    - AB: Project is organised with issues for each non-FAIRmat contributions (Project#4). Let us take an issue and review them! Issues have been distributed for review…
  - Organisation
    - AB: Number of base classes and AppDefs are increasing. We need a better organisation rather than having a flat list. AppDef could be according to experiment types
    - PM: AppDef organisation according to experiment technique could use categories from PaNET ontology.
    - AB: Base Classes are tricky. Maybe according to usage, like from most common to less used.
    - PC: general definitions shall be on top, specific ones could be groupped
    - PM: maybe tags and filters could be introduced
    - HB: we miss keywords as manually curated list of topics foreach the definitions 

* acknowleding fundings
  - PM: is funding contribution acknowledged?
  - AB: on the webpage we have place for it, but we have not used it a lot
  - PM: we could acknowledge FAIRmat for recent contribution
