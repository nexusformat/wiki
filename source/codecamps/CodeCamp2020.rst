      .. rubric:: NeXus Code Camp - January 2020
         :name: nexus-code-camp---january-2020
         :class: page-title

      The 2020 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for 3 days in January 2020:
      Jan 21 (Tuesday) - 23 (Thursday). The code camp will take place at
      the `Advanced Photon Source <https://www.aps.anl.gov>`__, `Argonne
      National Laboratory <https://www.anl.gov>`__, IL, USA (near
      Chicago).

      (We used an `online
      poll <https://doodle.com/poll/kf5xvbudzf2ccg6s>`__ to help decide
      the exact dates.)

      NeXus periodically convenes a Code Camp to develop NeXus software
      components through intense effort by small groups working on
      specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those attending
      the 2020 NeXus Code Camp will already have a strong foundation and
      understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
      knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during
      the event.

      Specific projects and tasks are described on the `GitHub issue
      tracker <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestones>`__.
      Issues for consideration at 2020 NeXus Code Camp will be added to
      the Code Camp's `Topics page <CodeCamp2020-topics.html>`__
      (edit here <../../source/codecamps/CodeCamp2020-topics.rst>).
      These issues will be prioritized on the first day for handling at
      the Code Camp.

      (For more info on code camps, try searching Google for 'code camp'
      or 'codeathon'. Events such as the `EPICS
      Codeathon <https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php>`__
      would be reasonable templates for this NeXus code camp.)

      Suggestions:

      -  We should take this opportunity to provide the standard
         *Introduction to NeXus* as a public presentation.
      -  We should allow time for an open, working lunch on one of the
         days to interact with the community able to attend.
      -  If someone wishes to make any other public presentation, either
         during, before, or after the Code Camp, please contact the
         host.

         to work on and resolve during this code camp.

         -  this took longer than expected (about 90 minutes)
         -  we used a `shared Google Docs
            spreadsheet <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFmKNXikbNSG9uAbkhS2UmtvJpQRxQmWyDlSRthE9cA/edit?usp=sharing>`__

      .. rubric:: Minutes for the meeting
         :name: minutes-for-the-meeting

      | We don't typically record minutes for the Code Camps.
      | Rather, the work progress is recorded in the GitHub issue
        trackers for the various repositories involved.

      We'll note here certain progress items or any questions or
      recommendations for the NIAC.

      -  We are looking to `publish the manual through GitHub
         Pages <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/663>`__:
         https://manual.nexusformat.org
      -  We made excellent progress on the *Gold Standard for NXmx*,
         helping both the MX, FEL, and synchrotron communities and the
         vendor support.
      -  We have registered a `DOI with
         zenodo <https://zenodo.org/record/3629571>`__ that updates with
         each release of the definitions repository. The DOI link is
         noted on our `GitHub home
         page <https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions>`__.
      -  We expect to make a release of NXDL 2020.1 on 2020-01-31.

      .. rubric:: Code Camp Tasks
