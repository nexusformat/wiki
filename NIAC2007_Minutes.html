<p>They should all be moved into Subversion.</p>
<p>Current status is that Freddie Akeroyd has moved all base classes, but
input from other NIAC members is required on naming of instrument
definitions before moving them too. This leads onto the open question of
how to name definitions like <a class="reference external" href="TOFRaw.html" title="wikilink">TOFRaw</a> – should all
definitions have an NX prefix like base classes or not?</p>
<p>Pete Jemian suggests differentiating names between Instruments + Base
classes – maybe using an NXD prefix for definitions?</p>

<p>Nick Hauser raised the point of how to speed up adopting proposals.
Thomas mentioned there is a lack of manpower. Therefore we need a simple
web interface. Freddie suggested adding an upload page. Mark said put
new proposals on the wiki or send an email to the NIAC via the
nexus-committee mailing list.</p>
<p>Andy raised the point that we need a manual. The current documentation
is very techie oriented. There is no introduction for beginners. Ray
said the wiki is the documentation. Pete Jemian suggested making full
use of the wiki and the discussion page on the wiki. Mark said the
problem is the wiki is not kept updated. Conclusion – breakout group on
how to organise wiki for users</p>

<h3>Pete Petersons’ talk - Trees<a class="headerlink" href="#pete-petersons-talk-trees" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pete gave a fascinating talk about trees and Nexus. In his vision Nexus
would be machine validated in future versions (V2.1), object oriented
definitions (V3.0) i.e. get rid of meta-DTD</p>
</section>
<section id="nick-s-talk-meta-dtd-vs-schema">
<h3>Nick’s talk - Meta-DTD vs. Schema<a class="headerlink" href="#nick-s-talk-meta-dtd-vs-schema" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Schema are machine readable XML. How to generate the schema ? A small
group of specialists will do this. Use a graphical schema editor. Easy
to generate meta-DTD from schema. Tools – emacs, Eclipse + WTP, Netbeans
are all free. General interest in using Eclipse + WTP and providing it
as a web start. Jens showed his C++ tool for defining instruments.</p>
<p>PROPOSAL : canonical Nexus definitions to be stored in schema. Meta-dtd can be generated from these</p>
<p>Thomas – 3 action types – move to schema, explain tools,</p>
<p>VOTE : Nexus meta-DTD to be moved to schema FOR : all ; AGAINST : none</p>
<p>Mark use schema for V3.0 and object oriented</p>
<p>VOTE : Version 3.0 will be schema based</p>
<p>Nick happy to manage this move with help others What other formats
should we support e.g. html, tables, uml</p>

<h3>Mark’s talk – Primer on Nexus and object oriented<a class="headerlink" href="#mark-s-talk-primer-on-nexus-and-object-oriented" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mark presented uml diagrams for the different base classes. Thomas said
an Instrument definition is actually an experiment definition i.e.
analysis-driven. Thomas suggested having multiple instrument classes
stored for the same instrument stored in the same file e.g. GSAS class
and Instrument class.</p>
<p>Nick presented NexusBeans as a Java technology. Ray said there is
general agreement that an object oriented type api is the way to go.
Pete Petersons’s talk – on URL’s URI – version, implementation version
e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.nexusformat.org/NXmonotas-NIAC2006.html">https://www.nexusformat.org/NXmonotas-NIAC2006.html</a></p>

<p>Laurent suggested do not include the version in the uri. Freddie wanted
to have a url and uri.</p>

<section id="imgcif">
<h3>imgCIF<a class="headerlink" href="#imgcif" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>A discussion ensued on imgCIF and what is happening in this field. Nick
read an email from Herbert Bernstein. Freddie mentioned the imgCIF
meeting in Manchester. There it was decided that the first step is to do
an imgCIF to NX and back converter, Freddie and Herbert Bernstein will
handle this. Stuart is our official contact with imgCIF.</p>

<section id="netcdf">
<h3>netCDF<a class="headerlink" href="#netcdf" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Nick gave a talk about netCDF. netCDF has a number of advantages e.g.
gives array manipulation in Java. Nick proposes to promote netCDF within
the Nexus community as a tool for reading and writing HDF5 in Nexus.
netCDF have added support for HDF5. Mark said there are a lot of issues
to consider, array manipulation of netCDF is an advantage, we need to
discuss with netCDF team to see how far they can go to support us. Pete
P. said there is a discussion on an Nxutility api. Nick said netCDF
provides a memory object. Pete P. discussion is about an in memory data
format. Ray needs a white paper with more information. Pete P. create a
separate api based on netCDF. Nick noted if the NIAC adopts netCDF for
internal data representation then this opens the way to sharing more
code. Andy suggested to start sharing netCDF between a few institutes to
gain more experience and then report back to the committee before making
a general decision on whether to support netCDF or not.</p>
<p>CONCLUSION : more people to try out netCDF and bring this up again at the meeting</p>

<section id="nexus-top-level-entry">
<h3>Nexus top level entry<a class="headerlink" href="#nexus-top-level-entry" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ray relayed a request from microscopists to have a top level entry which
identifies Nexus files e.g. /nexus. Mark said we should invite someone
from this community to discuss with us. NXEntry is an attribute on a
name and not a namespace. This could be done automatically by the napi.
Nick said there was a problem with conformity and validation.</p>

<h3>Argonne Scattering and Imaging Institute<a class="headerlink" href="#argonne-scattering-and-imaging-institute" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ray gave a talk on the ASI^2 proposal. If it gets funding then would be
largest investment by the DOE in software. Other communities are solving
problems which are of interest to us, idea is to get these people on
board. How should this group interact with the Nexus group ? ASI^2 could
replace IPNS as institute. Pete Jemian proposed next NIAC to be held at
Argonne</p>

<section id="improving-scientific-efficiency-at-aps">
<h3>Improving Scientific efficiency at APS<a class="headerlink" href="#improving-scientific-efficiency-at-aps" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Pete Jemian gave a talk on Improving Scientific Efficiency at APS. He
showed the canonical Scientific Workflow Diagram – feedback is open loop
at the moment. There is a working group headed by Ken Evans. APS has
created a Scientific Software Section for solving local challenges as
opposed to the ASI^2 which is for grand challenges. The group consists
of one person at present, it will grow in time. There is a pilot
visualisation application with 1-ID. There is resistance to Java +
Eclipse - Python is the lingua franca of scientists. This group could
look after a Nexus person. Nick said the NIAC should endorse this
position. The group is interested in helping the community. Ray said we
need funding for Nexus meetings. Thomas suggested this should be
contributed by each institute.</p>
<p>ACTION : Pete P to talk to SNS to setup a fund for Nexus MeetingsBeans<br />
ACTION : everyone to talk to their management on how much they can contribute to the fund<br />
ACTION : everyone to send their Berlin trip costs to the secretaries<br />
ACTION : Thomas to look into how much it costs to finance half a person</p>
<p>Next meeting candidates are :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Argonne</p></li>
<li><p>Australia (NOBUGS)</p></li>
<li><p>SNS</p></li>
</ul>
<p>CONCLUSION : next NIAC meeting at NOBUGS with 6 month meeting possibility at Argonne if ASI^2 is funded</p>
<p>There was a long discussion about breakout groups.</p>

<section id="nexus-api-oo">
<h3>Nexus API OO<a class="headerlink" href="#nexus-api-oo" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mark gave a talk about the Nexus OO API. He made the following proposals
:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>maintain file structure as a tree in memory</p></li>
<li><p>larger data sets are left on file and retrieved or written on demand</p></li>
<li><p>Nxclose, Nxflush serialise all changes to disk</p></li>
<li><p>how to link items together ?</p></li>
<li><p>what shall the shape of the Iterator class be ?</p></li>
<li><p>how much leeway are implementers allowed ?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There was a counter proposal by Pete Peterson. A python api which uses
the Nxfile as an object. Ray said this is not object oriented. Ray wants
to add to NXData together. Pete is against building a Nexus scripting
framework like Ray wants it. Pete P. said for python drop swig and write
python binding by hand, return NumPy objects. Pete proposes to write
zeroth level python binding – strings are python strings, scalars are
python basic types (he has already done most of the work)</p>
<p>ACTION : Pete to do Python binding to NumPy</p>
<p>Ray will play with the Python binding to generate a library for
manipulating Nexus data</p>
<p>ACTION : Ray to play with Python binding and make a proposal for manipulating Nexus data</p>
<p>Pete proposed code for C++ binding, supports void and std::vector
put_slab() Pete – current Java binding returns an object which has to
be cast to the right type, Pete proposes to extend the api to return a
typed type</p>
<p>ACTION : Freddie to add Pete’s C++ binding to be added to Nexus source code distribution</p>
<p>Mark would like templates to be an option in the C++ binding Pete would
like to have doxygen comments in the C napi,</p>
<p>ACTION : Mark will add doxygen comments to napi.h</p>
<p>Mark proposed an IDL binding</p>
<p>ACTION : Freddie to add Mark’s IDL binding to Nexus repository</p>

Subject: Re: NIAC meeting (fwd)

Dear Peter,

   Here is the current status.

   cif2nx:  I have been working on a conversion utility from CIF or CBF
to a NeXus file, but with additional groups so all the CIF tags can have
a home without colliding with the existing NeXus tags.  The idea will be
to then complete the cross-mapping of the CIF table-oriented structure
to the NeXus tree structure using the NeXus API and then to prune out
the duplications.  So far I have the complete parse of the CIF data and
the loading of the CIF dictionaries and am working on the following
initial mapping:

   Each CIF data block maps to group NXentry, with the name of the
datablock prefixed by &quot;NXcif_&quot;

   Each CIF category within a CIF data block maps to a new group
NXcifcat (as a subgroup of NXentry) with the name of the CIF category
prefixed by &quot;NXcif_&quot;

   Each column within a CIF category maps in one of two ways depending
on whether it contains any binary sections.  If there are no binary
sections, the entire column maps as a rank 2 data array with a column of
the CIF data values as strings and a column of the CIF data types as
strings.  In this case the entire column is one NeXus data set with the
name of the CIF column prefixed by &quot;NXcif_&quot;  If there are  binary
sections, then instead of using one data set, a column is mapped to a
new group NXcifcol that contains multiple arrays of whatever ranks fit
the binary sections, and the data sets are given names consisting of the
row number converted to a string and prefixed by NXcif_.  (This is a
rework of the approach to the handling of columns that I had been
following in which each data item in a column was a separate data set to
allow for the handling of binary section.  I think this new mixed
approach will provide a reasonable balance between performance 
and flexibility.)

   Each CIF save frame within a CIF data block maps to a new group
NXcifsf (as a subgroup of NXentry).  Each CIF category within a CIF save
frame maps to the group NXcifcat (as a subgroup of NXcifsf in this case)
and then the columns are handled as above.

   It would be nice if we could add the packed and byte offset
compressions to the current list of NeXus compressions, but this is not
critical.

   I hope to have this first cut done and tested in a few more days, and
then I will try to upload this phase to the NeXus repository under
contrib. Freddie offered to handle the NeXus side of the code, but I
seem to be getting along well with the API, so I will try to go a little
further first.

   Once that is done, the next step is to do the denormalization of the
CIF categories, using the dictionary information that has been loaded to
identify the cases in which tables in subcategories should be broken up
and moved under the parent items in the supercategories.

   Finally, the last step will be to translate those CIF tags that match
NeXus tags into the equivalent NeXus tags.  Those that don&#39;t match would
stay as CIF tags.

   nx2cif:  If the cif2nx works out the other direction should be a lot
easier, since there are fewer NeXus tags than CIF tags.   The biggest
problem will be preserving the finer type details from NeXus on the CIF
side.

   binutf:  G. Darakev is working on integrating binutf into the NeXus
API.  Thsi will allow fairly efficient handling of NeXus binaries in
XML.


   Regards,
     Herbert
