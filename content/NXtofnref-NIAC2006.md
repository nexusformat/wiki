Concerns:

-   mono and tof reflectometry must inherit from a common base class;
    the current definition of tofnref inheriting from monoref leaves the
    definition of the monochromator in the TOF definition.
-   SNS Liquids has two monitors, but our definitions only have one.
    Both are not always active.

    * Make it a subclass of NXmonoref

          Some instruments will require gravitational corrections.  Neutrons
          travel on a parabolic trajectory.  For long wavelength neutrons
          this changes incident and reflected angle and results in the
          neutron appearing on a lower detector pixel than expected.  The
          information required for these corrections comes from the instrument
          geometry.

          chopper is set to select low wavelength neutrons (those from
          the current pulse) or high wavelength neutrons (those from
          the previous pulse.

          On a properly tuned instrument, the time bins recorded in 
          the detector will reflect the actions of the choppers and
          these fields can be ignored. }

            { The frame overlap mirror is used to eliminate very long wavelength 
          neutrons from previous pulses.  Together with the choppers, this
          helps to choose which pulse to use in the TOF calculations.  On a 
          properly tuned instrument the time bins recorded in the detector
          will account for the actions of the mirror.

          There will be some attenuation but this will be compensated for 
          when correcting for the spectrum scan.

          For an ab initio calculation, you would need to store the angle 
          wrt the beam to compute the cutoff angle but often this will not
          be explicit since the instrument is simply tuned to have the
          correct cutoff. }
