### Report from Code Camp

Essentially as captured in the minutes.

Ray suggested the use of the nexusformat python package for features. That was already being tried, but would need additions to the package. Those would be welcome.

Discussion and clarification on the example file with axes with Ray.

### AOB

Ray: People in the US are working on a materials database similar to ICAT. Question to think about: Should there be a tag for the things to drag into a catalogue.
