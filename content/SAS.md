Small-Angle Scattering
======================

2006-04-19
----------

Given the complex requirements for initial data treatment on pulsed
source SANS instruments there has been general agreement to separate
these from the much simpler pin-hole geometry cameras used for
monochromatic X-ray and Neutron SAS studies, shown together below as
NXmonosas.

----------

Effort was made to simplify the definition below, correct errors (such
as removed fields that did not exist in base classes), and remove
unnecessary information.

Suggest that this be called *NXsas\_mono\_area* (very cumbersome) since
the fields are appropriate to SAS instruments with area detectors at
monochromatics sources. The definition does not match well to other
types of SAS instrument such as USAS, Kratky, step-scanning, or
slit-camera with PSD.

A description of the wavelength and possibly a spectral description
(either vague or detailed such as a spectral profile) is needed for
analysis software to account for not only wavelength but wavelength
smearing and other spectral effects (high-order harmonics, for example).
Due to the variety of optics used to provide such a beam, rather than
define each of those possible optics in the generic instrument
definition, we define the spectral properties of the beam incident on
the sample that results from all the upstream optics.

Two possible ways:

-   Object-oriented approach
    -   This needs a new base class since a generic SAS description will
        define wavelength using generic hardware; not everyone has
        helical velocity selector or a crystal monochromator. X-rays are
        admittedly the more tedious case.
    -   NXspectrum might be a good choice.
    -   NXwavelength\_selector is more to the point.
    -   NXmonochromator is our choice. This will sit well next to
        NXbending\_magnet, NXcrystal, NXinsertion\_device, NXmirror,
        NXmoderator, and NXvelocity\_selector.

-   NXbeam
    -   Imperfect becuase NXbeam was intended for the simulation
        community despite the note in the documentation about beamline
        use. The fields are not entirely appropriate and some questions
        will often arise.
