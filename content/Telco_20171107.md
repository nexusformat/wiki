Minutes
-------

Present: AB, EW, MB, MK, PJ, TSR

### Report from HDF5 Workshop
 * C++ HDF5 API presented by EW
 * Filters - HDF Group optentially has plans to sell them for writing, reading will be free. Do we want to compete with our repo?
 * HDF Group still aims to be more open source - opening their bug tracker and linking to a git repo from their web pages

### Github Issues
Two old ones have been looked at now: NXlog has the time dataset changed from NX_INT to NX_NUMBER (was probably TSR's editing error in the first place). And we decided some English language is required near the "data" dataset in Nxdetector to ensure people don't think 4 dimensions are mandatory.

Two tickets have been generated by Ray and require further input from him.  Mark B produces more example files for him to digest and will send link to Dawn source code that deal with axes for plotting.
Validation shall already check for dimensions for _indices etc in NXdata. Maybe a feature to extract the information would help.
