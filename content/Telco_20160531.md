Minutes

Present: HJB, MB, PJ, MK, EW, TSR, AB, ORNL (Mathieu and Steven)

### Welcome

Especially the ORNL!

### Github Issues

-   definitions \#387 - consensus is that this may solve one problem
    well, but certainly does not address all aspects of versioning.
    There was debate whether versioning the definitions as a whole was
    actually required. We encourage people to look into this to have an
    informed discussion at the NIAC and code camp.
-   code \#329 - branch can go
-   code \#419 header files will be added
-   code \#426 TSR's problem, but adding an API function to expose
    information about the backend may be required
-   code \#421 assigned to different developer

### NAPI release update

Could be done from master this week with the limited amount of changes
that went in so far. The release with support for HDF 1.10 may be NAPI
4.5 anyway, due to the high number of changes.

### NXcontainer

To be merged. There is a low bar for accepting contributed definitions.

MB mentions that the use of NXshape in NXontainer may require revision.
That is to be evaluated and presented at NIAC.

### Items for NIAC

There is a repo for NIAC items. Please add thing that will need in depth
discussions early so we can be prepared. We may assign items to people
for preparation in later telcos.

### CXI Compatibility

CXI uses a n by 3 array where NeXus is more flexible and allows multiple
1D arrays of length n. To be compatible with both standards for a smooth
transition having the data both ways may a way. Doing that using HDF
virtual dataset would save storing the data twice. As far as NXDL is
concerned that data just needs to be provided twice, virtual dataset is
transparent to our abstraction.

### Class diagram

Very informative, might be too scary for newcomers. But we will try a
nicer layout. It is a useful tool for us in any case. Could be in an
advance section of the manual.
