Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------

What is NXdir?:NXdir is a console tool used for inspection the contents of a NeXus file, it can print out the organization of the file as well as any data enclosed. It is intended to be a cross between the unix tools ls and grep. It should help people writing scripts access to NeXus files without having to compile in the NeXus API.  
The way NXdir prints arrays is hard to read, could you please change it?:No, but a format easier for you to read can be added. Please send <petersonpf@ornl.gov> an example of a two dimensional array in a format you like.
