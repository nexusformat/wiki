The NeXus Design page lists the group classes from which a NeXus file is
constructed. They provide the glossary of items that could, in
principle, be stored in a standard-conforming NeXus file (other items
may be inserted into the file if the author wishes, but they won't be
part of the standard). If you are going to include a particular piece of
metadata, consult the [class definitions](Design.html "wikilink") to find out
what to call it. However, to assist those writing data analysis
software, it is useful to provide more than a glossary; it is important
to define the required contents of NeXus files that contain data from
particular classes of neutron, x-ray, or muon instrument.

As part of the NeXus standard, we have identified a number of generic
instruments that describe an appreciable number of existing instruments
around the world. Although not identical in every detail, they share
enough common characteristics, and more importantly, they require
sufficiently similar modes of data analysis, to make a standard
description useful. They are in the process of being defined for the
NeXus standard. The definitions will be in XML using the NXDL (NeXus
Definition Language) format.

Instrument Definitions List
---------------------------

### TRAC

[Pete](User%3APete_Jemian.html "wikilink") 15:49, 14 December 2009 (UTC):
[NeXus definitions TRAC ticket
\#3](http://trac.nexusformat.org/definitions/ticket/3) was created to
describe the items on this page. Classes that were not already described
in NXDL have TRAC tickets created. The status of each of these classes
is described in the comments on that page. All new propositions for
classes should be described with a [new TRAC
ticket](http://trac.nexusformat.org/definitions/newticket).

### Ratified

These have been voted on by the [NIAC](NIAC.html "wikilink") and so are
official NeXus definitions

-   [NXTOFRaw: Time-of-Flight Raw Data](TOFRaw.html "wikilink") Editors:
    [Freddie Akeroyd](User%3AFreddie_Akeroyd.html "wikilink"), [Peter
    Peterson](User%3APeter_Peterson.html "wikilink")
-   [Monochromatic Neutron and X-ray Powder
    Diffraction](Monochromatic_Neutron_and_X-ray_Powder_Diffraction.html "wikilink")

-   [Generic Scanning Instrument](GenericScan.html "wikilink") Editor: [Mark

    Editor: [Nicholas Maliszewskyj](User%3ANickm.html "wikilink") (NIST
    Center for Neutron Research, USA).

### Proposed

In this case the need for a particular definition has been identified,
an editor has been assigned and some detailed discussions have taken
place; however the definition has not yet been voted on by the
[NIAC](NIAC.html "wikilink") and so could still undergo modification.

undergo major revisions. When they near completion they will be moved
into the *Proposed* category above.
