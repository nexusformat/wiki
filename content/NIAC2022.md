The NIAC2022 meeting will be held as a hybrid event hosted by the Paul Scherrer Institute on September 14-16th, which is the week before the [2022 NOBUGS conference](https://www.nobugsconference.org/). As COVID19 continues to be a concern, people will be able to participate both onsite and online (via Zoom). In order to better overlap with other time zones (especially in the Americas), the meeting sessions will be shorter and later in the day (CEST) over 3 days (instead of the usual 2 days).

Registration
------------
[Registration Form](https://indico.psi.ch/event/13249/registrations/1773/)
We ask that all participants register for the meeting, regardless of whether they will be joining in person or online so that sufficient resources can be organised. People outside of the NIAC are invited to join discussions and register for the meeting but voting will be restricted to committee members only.
