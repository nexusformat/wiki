NXtranslate - the anything to NeXus converter
---------------------------------------------

NXtranslate is an extensible console based tool that allows creating
NeXus files from information stored in other places. The program works
by parsing a translation file, which describes the structure of the
resulting file, and libraries that understand different file formats,
databases, etc. to retrieve information and put it into the resulting
NeXus file. NXtranslate was designed with “plugins” in mind to read from
new formats as needed.

Q: What do you mean by “anything to NeXus”?

A: Because NXtranslate is extensible it can get information from more
places as new retrievers are written. Since there is no inherent
limitation on what retrievers are written, the information can be from
anything.
