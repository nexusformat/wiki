Minutes
-------

Present: Clemens Weninger, AB, EW, MW, TSR

### Welcome

Clemens takes over from David Schneider at LCLS. We welcome him very much.

### HDF5 filter repo

Most urgent problems:

- Missing Readme (should detail purpose and origin of the code)
- LZ4 test failure
- Top level build instructions (CMake)

### PDB

No HJB, no report

### NXreflections

Nice pull request created by AB. Discussed some documentation issues and technical improvement. Easy to get to a finished state soon, except maybe for the flags.

### NXcontainer

MW created a pull request in exampledata with files to illustrate the ideas, which have changed from the original proposal.
We didn't have time to look at them in detail. Will discuss next time.

### Next Meeting
[Telco 20170628](Telco_20170628.html)

### AOB 

MW also has a pull request for NXstage, which is quite similar to NXtransformations.
There was potential need identified for grouping certain instrument devices, but that may lead to slightly arbitrary grouping, based on personal preference. Depending on location, funciton, motion, etc. We'll pick up the discussion next time again.
