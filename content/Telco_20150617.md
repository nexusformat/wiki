    -   Axis attributes in NXdetector e.g

`   Fluo : NXdetector`  
`       @signal = data`  
`       @axes = (,,,energy)`  
`       @energy_indices = (3)`  
`       data[10,20,180,1024]`  
`           @interpretation = spectrum`  
`       energy[1024]`  
`           @units = keV`

Present: MK, MB, EW, HJB, TSR, AF (Dectris, from holiday!)

NXmx, fill values

  
  
This started from an Dectris Eiger problem of having to write fields
without knowing values. Those are them meant to be filled in by beamline
acquisition system. Since as far as NeXus is concerned a fully populated
file should leave the facility, this is nothing we have a strong opinion
about. Writing an empty array (dimension 0) would work.

NXmx, shutterless

  
  
All resolved to everyone's satisfaction.

NXmx, relative depends\_on path

  
  
Not deemed required, for the moment.

Documentation, detector pixel origin

  
  
Eugen volunteered to have a look at this. Potentially including detector
modules and related “new” areas.

Documentation, general review of tickets

  
  
Quite a number of tickets are open on the definitions repository, some
of them very old. A good number of them could potentially be closed.
Looking through them and at least commenting would help the next person
make a decision. Action on all.

Plans for Code Camp an future

  
  
Eugen will advertise Code Camp on the mailing list shortly. Please have
a think about ideas to tackle there and what we need to do
strategically. Ideas so far include validation, NAPI, features.

example file repository

  
  
Is in need of new files. This would help developers to find bugs in
their code and develop common data extraction methods. Maybe a github
repo is not the best choice, for data size reasons. Might investigate at
the code camp.

Next meeting will be [Telco 20150630](Telco_20150630.html "wikilink")

AOB

  
  
Mark Basham suggests a scheme to attribute detector axes (like for an
energy dispersive detector) analogue to NXdata. Not all detector must
have an NXdata, otherwise that could be used directly. MK asserts that
this looks good and we certainly should not have two schemes (NXdata vs
NXdetector) to assign axes. Will revisit that at next telco.
