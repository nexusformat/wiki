Minutes
-------

Present: MB, MK, PJ, HJB, TSR

NXdetector origin and depends\_on clarified. Herbert sent out an email
to the discussion list: Depends\_on point to the centre of any object
unless otherwise specified. The most important (and only for the moment)
“otherwise specified” case being NXdetector, where the depends\_on
locates the first pixel. The first one being the first one in the data.
Otherwise there is some documentation missing or not sufficiently
referenced in the manual describing the CIF geometry. To that end Ticket
273 is assigned to Tobias for now.

NAPI release, Code Camp & Logo: Not discussed due to lack of relevant
people.

AOB: SNS representative elected, email will go out shortly. Use of
application definitions should be surveyed more frequently, could come
out of feature development.

Next meeting will be [Telco 20150302](Telco_20150302.html "wikilink")
