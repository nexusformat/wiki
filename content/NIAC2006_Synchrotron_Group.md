Nexus – Synchrotron breakout group
----------------------------------

These are notes from our first discussion on 2006-02-01

present : AG (ESRF), RW (ESRF), PJ (APS), CM (Soleil), SP (Soleil), SC
(Diamond), LL (CCLRC,RAL)

RW – ESRF has their own format but willing to adopt

PJ – need an international collaborative effort, EPICS low level

SP – Soleil has adopted Nexus, need tools, developed a tango generic
system store data in Nexus, NO DATA to store yet, need to start quickly
to store data, do not need a complete DTD

SC – committed to Nexus, MX beamlines will store imageCIF, prefer to
store data in Nexus in the long term, EPICS low level simulators, simple
classes to start with

LL – working on catalogue information, TOF meta-data definition, data
portal to access different type of data for modelled and measured data

PJ – basic questions about which class contains which ?

#### NXsource additions

| Name    | Type          | Description                                          |
|---------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|

### Questions

1.  Can we have NX\_BOOLEAN ?
2.  Do we have to use microamp units for current ?
3.  Why is NXmonitor not NXdata ?

### IDEAS

NXbeam\_position\_monitor could be a separate class (subclass of NXlog)
?
