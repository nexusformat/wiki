NeXus Workshop at PSI (May 10 - 12, 2010)
-----------------------------------------

A NeXus workshop will be held at PSI from Monday, May 10 till Wednesday,
May 12 2010. The purpose of this workshop is twofold:

-   Disseminate detailed knowledge about the NeXus data format
-   Discuss and develop the application of NeXus at synchrotron light
    sources.

In a sense this workshop is a followup to the recent [HDF-5 as
hyperspectral
dataformat](http://www.esrf.eu/events/conferences/hdf5-as-hyperspectral-data-analysis-format)
held at ESRF.

This workshop is to go into more detail and come up with:

-   A wishlist of things to consider for the [NeXus International
    Advisory Committee](NIAC.html "wikilink")
-   A set of synchrotron specific application definitions.

The intended audience for this workshop are facility scientists and
computing staff from synchrotrons who have have an interest to learn
more about NeXus and use it a synchrotron light sources. The general
part of the workshop can be of interest to other NeXus users too.

Particiaption is free but due to space contraints we can only accept 30
participants. Registration is now open through our WWW-site:
