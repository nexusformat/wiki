The 2020 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for 2 days in October 2020:
October 17 (Saturday) - 18 (Sunday). It is taking place immediately after the [NOBUGS 2020 conference](https://tiny.cc/nobugs2020) which is hosted by the [European XFEL](https://www.xfel.eu/)

## Purpose

The Saturday of the Code Camp will be primarily an open help session for people to ask detailed questions and request specific help from core NeXus developers, e.g. writing an application definition or writing a NeXus file correctly. The Sunday will be more for the core NeXus developers to work on implementing NIAC decisions.

If you have a topic you wish to discuss/cover in the Saturday code camp, please add it as a comment to this [GitHub issue]( https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues/38)

NeXus periodically convenes a Code Camp to
develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small groups
working on specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those
attending the Sunday Code Camp session will already have a strong foundation
and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during the
event. 

(For more info on code camps, try searching Google for “code camp” or
“codeathon”. Events such as the [EPICS
Codeathon](https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php) would be
reasonable templates for this NeXus code camp.)

## Registration

Registration for the NIAC and code camp is only necessary if you are attending in person and is done as part of the [NOBUGS 2020 conference](https://tiny.cc/nobugs2020) registration.

### Costs

The code camp will cost 20 EUR/person/day, which covers coffee breaks and lunch costs.
