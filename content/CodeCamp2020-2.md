The 2020-2 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for 2 days in October 2020:
October 19 (Monday) - 20 (Tuesday). It is taking place one week after the [2020 NIAC meeting](https://www.nexusformat.org/NIAC2020.html). It was originally planned to be immediately after the [NOBUGS 2020 conference](https://tiny.cc/nobugs2020), hosted by the [European XFEL](https://www.xfel.eu/), but NOBUGS has been postponed and the 2020 NIAC become an online meeting.

## Purpose

The Monday of the Code Camp will be primarily an open help session for people to ask detailed questions and request specific help from core NeXus developers, e.g. writing an application definition or writing a NeXus file correctly. The Tuesday will be more for the core NeXus developers to work on implementing [NIAC decisions](https://www.nexusformat.org/NIAC2020.html)

If you have a topic you wish to discuss/cover in the Monday code camp, please add it as a comment to this [GitHub issue]( https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues/38)

NeXus periodically convenes a Code Camp to
develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small groups
working on specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those
attending the Monday Code Camp session will already have a strong foundation
and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during the
event. 

(For more info on code camps, try searching Google for “code camp” or
“codeathon”. Events such as the [EPICS
Codeathon](https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php) would be
reasonable templates for this NeXus code camp.)

## Registration

Registration for the NIAC and code camp is not required.

Meetings will take place via Zoom - please post a message to the [NeXus codecamp list](mailto:codecamp@nexusformat.org) to receive an invitation to join.
