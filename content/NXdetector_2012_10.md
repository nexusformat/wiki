This is from an discussion about additions/modifications to NXdetector
to help Dectris as it decides to write raw image data into HDF5/NeXus
format.

    Hi,

    at the last teleconference we agreed that I do a summary of the state and 
    options on the DECTRIS/detector_element issue. Well, this is it.

    In the meantime the information came in that DECTRIS is joining the two 
    planned workshops with a date in mid-january. Thus I assume we have a little 
    more time to sort this out. 

    First the more political part: [...omitted...]

    Now the more technical part: let us start with a description of the problem:

    The EIGER (and other) detector is composed of multiple modules. All is fine 
    as long as these modules are arranged on a regular grid in order to form one 
    joint image. This can be easily stored in one NXdetector group. A mask stored 
    with the data gives information which pixels are valied and which are boundaries. 

    The problem starts when the individual modules are arranged in an irregular 
    arrangement: for example on a half sphere. Then there are two requirements:
    - The user still wants to see an image merged from the individual modules 
      in order to quickly get an overview of the data. This requirement is best 
      fulfilled by keeping the data in one fat array. 
    - For proper data analysis, more information on each individual module is 
      needed. This is:
      
      * The position of the module within the pixel array, offset and size
      * The physical position and orientation of the module with respect to
        the detector as a whole
        
    In order to handle this, there are several propositions.


    Use NXgeometry
    ================

    NXdetector
      module01,NXgeometry
           NXtranslation
           NXorientation

       module02,NXgeometry
           NXtranslation
           NXorientation

    .....
    This option is missing the index information. I am not sure if we want
    to add that to NXgeometry. I am also not sure if we still wish to
    advocate the use of NXgeometry. IMHO, the CIF mapping is better and
    NXgeometry may be deprecated soon.. But is not yet....


    NXdetector_element
    ======================

    The second option would be a new group: NXdetector_element looking like
    this:

    NXdetector
         distance
         module01,NXdetector_element
           x[nx]
             @transformation_type=translation
             @offset=x,y,z 
             @vector= ...
         depends_on=/entry/instrument/detector/distance 
           y[ny]
             @transformation_type=translation
             @offset=0,0,0
             @vector=....
         depends_on=x
           pixel_offset[2]=x,y
           
    The x any y arrays describe the pixels of the module. This is wasting 
    space as it is for example for x: x[0]=0*pixelsize, x[1] = 1*pixelsize,... 
    The offset and vector attributes the position and orientation in space. 
    The start indices go into the pixel_offset

       
    Tobias Suggestion
    =====================

    A variant based on the way CIF handles the same problem

    detector:NXdetector
         data[j,k,l] = [....]
         detector_arm[1] = [250]
             @transformation=translation
             @vector={1,0,0}
             @units=cm
             @depends_on=/entry/instrument/something/brick
         depends_on=detector_arm
         module:NXdetector_module
             data_origin[2] = [l,m]
             data_size[2] = [n,o]
             module_offset[1] = [250]
                 @transformation=translation
                 @vector={0,1,1}
                 @units=mm
                 @depends_on="../detector_arm"
             fast_pixel_direction[1] = [0.172]
                 @transformation=translation
                 @vector={1,0,0}
                 @units=mm
                 @depends_on="module_offset"
             slow_pixel_direction[1] = [0.172]
                 @transformation=translation
                 @vector={0,1,0}
                 @units=mm
                 @depends_on="module_offset"
         module:NXdetector_module
             ....

    This uses less space.


    SNS Usage
    ==============

    SNS had a similar problem and has resolved the issue by storing each detector 
    module in a separate NXdetector group. This works perfectly and would require 
    no change on our side. However, this would mean that DECTRIS would need to 
    change their data writing for this case. And vieweing the total image cannot be 
    done easily anymore without a reconstruction in SW or a duplication of data.

    This looks like:

    module01,NXdetector
          data[NP,i,j]
          distance
          ......
    module02,NXdetector
          data[NP,ij]
          distance...
    ....


    The General Case
    ====================

    What also works is the existing facility in NeXus to describe each 
    pixel individually. Any pixel gets an ID and there are arrays for 
    distance, coordinates etc which are nPixel long. With nPixel being  
    the total number of pixels. But this would again destroy the image.

    This looks like:

    detector,NXdetector
         data[NP,nPixel]
         distance[nPixel]
         x_pixel_offset[nPixel]
         y_pixel_offset[nPixel]
         ....
         
    Of course they may be many more options. But I hope these are enough 
    to find a solution
