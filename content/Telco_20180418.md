Minutes
-------

Present: HJB (from a moving vehicle), MK, TSR

Small and short meeting.

### Github issues

Looked at:

* [editorial corrections to NXlog](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/618): We agreed that the pull request captures the intent of the NIAC better than the current state of the NXDL and we will merge the correction. Before that we also need to add the `@scaling` to `cue_timestamp_zero` so the identical timestamps as in `time` can be used. TSR will make the change, MK will merge.

* [Add new geometry definitions](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/601): Agreed that `<choice>` is the best approach here, rather than fudging this in some other way. Needs changes to the rendering of the manual and the validation tool. MK volunteers to do the latter. PJ shall be approached for the NXDL work.

### Milestone

Not discussed due to lack of key people.

### NIAC and Code Camp Preparations

DOE problems, as always. But SIC offered to host in connection with NOBUGS. Could be an option to have NIAC after NOBUGS and Code Camp after NIAC, to implement decisions rather than preparing new ones. Will discuss next time with hopefully more people.

### AOB

EM definition progress: There was an email today that the proposers are about to create an example file to illustrate the ideas. This is going well.
