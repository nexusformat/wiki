-   Discussion items
    -   time\_focusing\_type (e.g. difc, cubic, ..)
    -   time\_focusing\_parameters \[ndetector,nparameters\]
    -   Definition of groups for binning in NeXus file or via NXdetector
        ?
    -   Deadtime correction information (in combination with gang\_..)
    -   Profile types and starting parameters
    -   Incident spectrum (here in NXcharacterization, alternative
        analytical description ?)

<!-- -->

-   Other
    -   Binned data back in NeXus - this actually is used in Rietveld.
