Since the [NOBUGS 2020 conference](https://tiny.cc/nobugs2020) has been postponed and continuing COVID-19 issues, the 2020 NIAC will be held as a series of teleconferences on Monday 12th and Tuesday 13th October (just prior to the orginal NOBUGS2020 dates). A [NeXus code camp](https://www.nexusformat.org/CodeCamp2020-2.html) will also be held as an online event on Monday 19th and Tuesday 20th October, the week after NIAC 2020. A final short NIAC session is planned for October 20th in order to deal with new issues discovered during the code camp. Precise details will be discussed at the [NeXus teleconferences](https://www.nexusformat.org/Teleconferences.html) and published here before October 1st.

Voting on changes to the NeXus standard is reserved for [committee members](https://www.nexusformat.org/NIAC.html), but any interested parties are welcome to observe and stimulate discussions. Topics for the NIAC meeting should be registered as
[issues](https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues) in the
[NIAC](https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC) repository on GitHub.

## Registration

Registration for the NIAC and code camp is probably not going to be required, but we might set up some way to indicate intended attendence in order to improve organisation.

## Video Conference details

We will be using Zoom (Please mute microphone when not speaking), you can [test your connection prior to a meeting](https://ukri.zoom.us/test)
