Code Camp
------
   * PJ offered to host code camp at ANL either on December 11-13th, or January 2020.
    * It was agreed that Dec was too soon and difficult to arrange travel, so Jan 2020 would be better.
   * Some discussion of what work should be targeted to justify a code camp
    * PJ points out lots of issues on github to clean, especially for the [definitions release that is now overdue](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/8)
   * PJ asked where to publish details
    * BW has created a page on the wiki that can be viewed at <https://www.nexusformat.org/CodeCamp2020.html>
   * PJ will create poll to decide precise dates
