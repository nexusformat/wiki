#### Version in NeXus Definitions and Classes

There is currently no technical infrastructure in place to make version
work in a way software developers would expect. For example git does not
allow easy access to a version of a file that contains a particular
version string. There are various ways to achieve this and people will
think about this.

In any case having a Changelog document or section on top of each file
would be a useful start in the right direction.

More thoughts and discussions needed.

#### Main Web Landing Page

The current content focusses on installation and documentation of the
API, which is not the main thing we offer (any more). This could be
changed easily.

There is a potential longer list of things to address and we can
generate and discuss a list of desirable changes.

The possibility of using Wordpress was brought up, but it was felt that
as a tool to serve a single page it would be a too heavy handled
solution. Another possibility was to use Sphinx with a nice template and
Ray and Pete will see if they want to make a suggestion.

Otherwise some CSS or other tools could be used to make this page look
nicer.

#### sample contain proposal

DLS have made some edits to allow for more flexible handling sample
containers in NXsample. ESS have made some changes to NXsample that sit
in a branch to address sample components and atom sites (analogue to
CIF) as well as fixing some crystallographic features. HJB suggested to
implement both orthogonal and fractional atom sites. Changes at least to
the documentation will be required to correct the description of
orientation matrices vs UB matrices.

#### recording of scan intend

DLS think they might be able to address their use case with the \_set
demand values. Probably no change or addition needed.

#### CXI

After some licensing problems DLS are talking to the community and they
appear happy to make the small changes required to make the current CXI
format fully NeXus compliant. Further updates in due course, but no
problems in sight.

#### cnxvalidate

No testers yet. Mark K is keen on feedback or bug reports.

#### Next meeting
