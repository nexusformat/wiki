Monochromatic Single Crystal Diffractometer with Single Detector
----------------------------------------------------------------

Instrument definition for a single crystal diffractometer at a
monochromatic neutron or X-ray beam. This is the single detector
version.

General Notes:

-   A Eulerian cradle is assumed. If you do not have this, or you are
    using a rotation camera, feel free to adapt the Nxsample group.
-   If you put measurements for multiple reflections in one file, they
    should go into separate entries.
-   The definition assumes the measurement to be an omega - two-theta or
    omega scan of a given reflection. If this is not the case, i.e. a
    general scan is performed, feel free to make HKL, chi and phi arrays
    with the length of the scan as a dimension. As the NeXus scan
    paradigm of the day requires.
-   This definition is fairly minimal and shall cater for standard data
    reduction needs. If your most favourite items are missing, feel free
    to add them. If you think something is missing which is required for
    standard data reduction tasks, please contact the maintainer of this
    definition.

    - NP is again the number of scan points.
