## NIAC2022 Minutes

### Session A

Present: BW, FA, PJ, LG, HG, SB, MK (Markus Kuhbach), RB, PC, SS (Sherjeel Shabih), AP (Allan Pinto), PM (Paolo Baraldi Mausbach)

BW began by summarising the meeting, and then there was a round of introductions as new people were present. As well as NIAC members, there were some observers from the Brazilian Synchrotron Light Laboratory (LNLS) and other facilities. AP mentioned that he had planned meeting with Diaomond and ESRF and was interested in learning more about NeXus, it was suggested that the monthly NeXus teleconferences would be good from this perspective. They are listed on the [Teleconferences]( https://www.nexusformat.org/Teleconferences.html) page and to be notified of their dates you can join the [nexus-tech](https://lists.nexusformat.org/mailman/listinfo/nexus-tech) mailing list. There is also the [nexus manual](https://manual.nexusformat.org/user_manual.html)

The list of items to discuss is kept as a [github project](https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/2) and the committee then took some time to look through the list and decide on who should represent a given issue at this or a future session.  

As there were not many members present it was decided to adjourn early and return in thew afternoon to discuss matters
