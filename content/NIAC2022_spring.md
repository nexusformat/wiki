The 2022 Spring virtual NIAC will be held on March 3rd and 4th, 2022. It aims to provide some decisions and feedback requested by the community.
Since it is not the "ordinary" biennial NIAC meeting, the [constitution](https://www.nexusformat.org/NIAC.html) lays out stricter rules for making decisions: 

"Voting outside of the biennial NIAC meetings can take two forms. Firstly, memberships can be approved by email ballot. All other issues require a teleconference for interactive discussion that is attended by at least 2/3 of the NIAC. Votes may be cast at the teleconference, as well as during the following week in order to allow NIAC members not attending the teleconference to add their vote to the tally. The opening of the voting period must be advertised through the NIAC mailing list. At the close of the 1-week voting period, NIAC members not responding are counted as abstained and the NIAC decision follows the voting category (usually “for” and “against”) with the highest number of valid votes."

Agenda and Sessions
----------------
The agenda items should bey issues in the [NIAC repository](https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/issues) (which should refer/link to issues in other repositories where appropriate) and organised via the [project](https://github.com/nexusformat/NIAC/projects/4).

The meeting will consist of 4 sessions over the 3rd and 4th of March, plus a 5th session at least a week later:
