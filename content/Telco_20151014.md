Minutes
-------

Present:

Eugen (only listening), Herbert, Andreas from Dectris, Pete Jemian, Mark
K.

-   Andreas brought up some question regrading trigger\_delay\_time
    which resolved into a clarification that the one in NeXus base class
    is the hardware trigger\_delay\_time. A new,
    effective\_trigger\_delay, time in proposed which will sum all
    trigger delays, from hardware or software or else.
-   As the main players for the other topics on the Agenda were not
    present, we discussed the NXvalidate white paper. Many points were
    resolved. Mark K will update the white paper with the results of the
    discussions shortly. It was felt that it is more important to get
    the things done rather then haggle for a long time about the optimal
    solution and details.
-   The discussion returned to NXmx. Uptake of NeXus/HDF-5 is still
    difficult. The problem are the data analysis package maintainers.
    Herbert suggested to have a workshop and help them get NeXus
    implemented around one of the big crystallographic conferences next
    year. Dectris may be supporting this workshop.
