4.3.0rc1
--------

Dowload the release candidate from the [NeXus download
page](http://download.nexusformat.org/kits/nx43testing.shtml). Issues
reported with this release [can be found
here](http://trac.nexusformat.org/code/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&status=closed&version=4.3.0-rc1&order=priority)
and results to testing on
[NeXus\_43\_Testing](NeXus_43_Testing.html "wikilink")

New Features
------------

-   Links to external files via the NeXus external linking mechanism
    have now been enhanced to take advantage of native HDF5 external
    linking. Previously a nexus external file link was only visible to
    NeXus aware programs, and this will continue to be the case for XML
    and HDF4 based files. In the case of files created with the HDF5
    underlying format, external file links will now be visible to any
    HDF5 (1.8.\*) aware program.
-   HDF5 based files can now have multiple “unlimited” dimensions
    (previously only one was allowed)
-   New API functions have been added to handle very large arrays. Most
    original NeXus functions had array dimensions of type “int” which
    restricted the maximum size of an array. New functions with a “64”
    suffix have been added which use int64\_t rather than int - existing
    functions continue to work as normal, so there is no need to update
    code unless you want to make use of the larger dimensions.
-   A new python tree API has been added (note: need to add link for
    more finformation)
-   A GUI java based NXvalidate program has now been added
-   The NeXus API now ensures thread safety, even if the underlying
    HDF/XML library is not built that way. The current approach would
    not allow any concurrency in writing, but HDF5 does not support this
    anyway at the moment.
-   A new function NXreopen() has been added which will create
    additional NXhandle objects from an existing NXhandle, allowing you
    to have several NXhandle structures referring to the same file. This
    can give a large performance gain if you need to write to different
    parts of a file as separate threads can be created with their own
    NXhandles, thus removing the need to open and close data groups that
    can lead to unnecessary flushing to disk etc.
-   New application NXtraverse added
-   TODO: other applications - anything of note changed in NXtranslate,
    NXsummary etc?

Changed Features
----------------

-   The HDF5 1.6.\* series libraries are no longer supported - NeXus now
    requires 1.8.\* or higher. The 1.6.\* series is now very old and
    moving to 1.8.\* has allowed us to make use of new and improved
    features, such as native external file linking (see above)

System Requirements
-------------------

**MXML XML Parsing Library**

Version 2.2.2 or higher of mxml is required. Earlier versions have a bug
and the XML API will not work. This package can be downloded in [both
source and binary rpm
form](http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/software.php) and is also
available as part of [Fedora
Extras](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras/UsingExtras). IMPORTANT
NOTE: Debian also provides the mxml package, but it based on 2.0 and
will not work properly.

**Python Interface** You will need both the numpy and ctypes modules to
be available. These are provided in both the Fedora and EPEL
repositories.

**HDF5 Version** Only the HDF5-1.8.\* series (and above) is now
supported.
