Problem
-------

In todays fluorescence experiments users often raster the sample with
the beam and record a single spectrum at each sample location. For
beamline P06 at DESY this procedure became virtually the default mode of
operation. The current NXfluo application definition does not include
this kind of experiments as it only allows to store a single spectrum
below /:NXentry/:NXinstrument/:NXdetector. However NXfluo could be
easily modified to accommodate raster scans.

Proposed modification
---------------------

The changes concern only the NXdetector instance of NXfluo. The layout
should be changed as follows

    entry:NXentry
      instrument:NXinstrument
        flourescence:NXdetector
          data[npts,nenergy]
          energy[npts,nenergy]

where npts denotes the number of raster points. It is important to note
that we do not care about the particular pattern used to raster the
sample. This would be hard to achieve taking into account that there is
a nearly arbitrary number of patterns available. Even entirely irregular
paths would be possible (and have already been requested by one of the
beamline scientists here at DESY). One advantage of this pattern
agnostic approach would be that analysis software can stick to its
current workflow: processing the spectra recorded during an experiment
in a simple sequential order.

If the energy dataset is of shape \[nenergy\] (rank one) we can assume
that the energy range was the same for each point recorded. A single
spectrum can easily be stored by using the original schema of the
definition which could be interpreted as ntps=0.

Just as a recommendation (must not go into the standard), it would make
sense to store the position of the beam on the sample like this

    entry:NXentry
      sample:NXsample
        x[npts]:NX_FLOAT
        y[npts]:NX_FLOAT  

Status 01/2015
--------------

The suggested change is in line with NeXus scan rules. Thus the change
was accepted at NIAC 2014. No vote was necessary.
