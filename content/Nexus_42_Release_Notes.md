4.2.1
-----

The following new featues have been added:

-   NXbrowse now has readline support (i.e. previous command line recall
    and TAB completion of entry names)
-   new API functions NXgetpath() and NXgetversion() added
-   NXgetnextentry() now uses less stack space

4.2.0
-----

System Requirements
-------------------

**MXML XML Parsing Library**

Version 2.2.2 or higher of mxml is required. Earlier versions have a bug
and the XML API will not work. This package can be downloded in [both
source and binary rpm
form](http://www.easysw.com/~mike/mxml/software.php) and is also
available as part of [Fedora
Extras](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Extras/UsingExtras). IMPORTANT
NOTE: Debian also provides the mxml package, but it based on 2.0 and
will not work properly.

**Python Interface** You will need both the numpy and ctypes modules to
be available. These are provided in both the Fedora and EPEL
repositories.

Building Notes
--------------

### NAG F90/F95 Compiler

The NAG compiler needs the **-mismatch** flag to be specified or else it
will not compile NXmodule.f90 This is achieve by running configure with
the **FCFLAGS** environment variable set to contain the flag e.g.

    env FCFLAGS="-mismatch" ./configure --with-f90=f95

### HDF4 on Intel Macs

There is a problem with the include file, hdfi.h (normally in
/usr/local/include). See
<http://coastwatch.noaa.gov/helparc/software/msg00069.html> for details
of the modifications necessary to fix it.

New Features
------------

### C++ Interface (provided by [Freddie Akeroyd](User%3AFreddie_Akeroyd.html "wikilink") and [Peter Peterson](User%3APeter_Peterson.html "wikilink"))

See the [doxygen
documentation](http://download.nexusformat.org/doxygen/html/classNeXus_1_1File.html)
and [NeXus API test
program](http://svn.nexusformat.org/code/branches/4.2/test/napi_test_cpp.cxx).
A C++ Stream Like interface is also supported - the idea is to provide
an IOSteam like interface and allow you to type

        // create an entry and a data item
        File nf(fname, NXACC_CREATE);
        nf << Group("entry1", "NXentry") << Data("dat1", w, "int_attr", 3);
        nf.close();

        File nf1(fname, NXACC_RDWR);
        // add a double_attr to an existing setup
        nf1 >> Group("entry1", "NXentry") >> Data("dat1") << Attr("double_attr", 6.0);
        nf1.close();

        // read back data items
        File nf2(fname, NXACC_READ);
        nf2 >> Group("entry1", "NXentry") >> Data("dat1", w1, "int_attr", i, "double_attr", d);
        // alternative way to read d1
        nf2 >> Data("dat1") >> Attr("double_attr", d1);

See also the [NeXus API test
program](http://svn.nexusformat.org/code/branches/4.2/test/napi_test_cpp.cxx)

### IDL Interface (provided by Jussi Kauppila and [Mark Koennecke](User%3AMark_Koennecke.html "wikilink"))

There is a new interface to RSI's Interactive Data Language, IDL for
NeXus. This interface has to be considered beta. Nevertheless it is
working most of the time. Known issues include:

-   Compressed reading and writing do not work for HDF-4 files, probably
    because of a library version conflict on libz.

### Python Interface

There is now, thanks to [Paul Kienzle](User%3APaul_Kienzle.html "wikilink"),
a supported interface for the python scripting language. Arrays are
stored in numpy arrays and thus allow for efficient data manipulations.
