Minutes

Present: MK, MB Andreas Foerster, HJB, PJ, TSR, FA, EW, Graeme Winter

Initial problems with hangout not allowing people to join the first two
participants under the old URL. New Hangout created.

Discussion on CMake: All look well now, except for the Windows build.
That could be solved by using the cmake inbuilt make. Eugen has updated
the ticket. In general small fixes can be done in master, larger
possibly disruptive chunks of work should be merged by an independent
person using a github pull request. This should be documented somewhere.

NXmx: Discussion on allowing beam\_center in units of pixels, instead of
official units of length. No real agreement why that would be necessary,
but also not a strong opposition. shutterless scans: One start and
either end or interval value would be required. Not more. Encoding could
be done via naming, or attributes. No consensus for now. A proposal will
be developed.

Moved remaining other items to next meeting.
