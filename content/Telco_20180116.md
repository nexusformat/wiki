### Welcome

Some mixup with Hangout, session was split for the first 10 minutes.

### NXdata

https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/602

Ray will edit and present next time. uncertainties should be perferred over the old _errors.

### Milestones

https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestones/NXDL%202018.1o

Action on all: Resolve all possible issues; at the next meeting advaocate then unresolved tickets that still should be part of the upcoming release. We still establish the target date then.


### multiple signals, ESRF proposal

(This took quite some time, just noting down one strand of the exchange.)

PJ: Support for generic plotting is a main goal of NeXus.

RO: Adding multiple signals does not explain to a program what to do with that additional data.

MK: Could suggest features to solve this. 

TSR: auxiliary_axes is a solved problem. Any number of axes are possible with _indices.

PJ: That could have been to use with the additional (auxillary) signal.

TSR: That would generate more problems (indices). Next action?

PJ: Ball in Armando's court to provide examples.


### Github issue of the day

 * https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/600 (target attribute) commented

### Next meeting

[Telco 20180130](Telco_20180130.html)

### AOB 

Mark may mean this: https://github.com/nexusformat/HDF5-External-Filter-Plugins
But if that doesn't satisfy his needs, bring it up next time (or on the mailing list).
