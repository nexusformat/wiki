This discussion concerns a proposal from [NIAC2008](NIAC2008.html "wikilink")
to rename [NXevent\_data](NXevent_data.html "wikilink") as NXtofevent\_data.
When this proposal was passed to the full committee, a number of issues
were raised and it was decided that a further round of discussion was
required.

Please comment on the proposals below on the [discussion
page](Talk:Storing_Event_Data.html "wikilink")

Listed below are some of the main reasons cited for and against:

REASONS FOR
-----------

-   NXtofevent\_data better describes the content of the object, given
    that [NXevent\_data](NXevent_data.html "wikilink") has a
    “time\_of\_flight” member

REASONS AGAINST
---------------

-   Event data is potentially of importance to the other communities and
    therefore it would be good to ensure that the definition name for
    event data is as general as possible. Event data is not always
    measured against “time\_of\_flight” - it may be e.g. muon decay time
    and so a more general “event\_time” axis may be applicable

<!-- -->

-   I'm not sure why the addition of “tof” is necessary. Pulsed source
    and chopped continuous source event data can be represented in ways
    that are substantially the same. By renaming the fields we can
    handle different kinds of events in the same manner, so there is no
    need to change the group name to be specific to time of flight

<!-- -->

-   NXtofevent\_data is an ugly name. NXtof\_event\_data is a better
    name, or just NXevent\_data

PROPOSAL from Paul Kienzle regarding contents of NXevent\_data
--------------------------------------------------------------

First note that either pulse\_height or pulse\_time is the wrong name.

-   pulse\_height\[i,k?\] refers to the voltage pulse measured by the
    detector
-   pulse\_time\[j\] refers to the time that the neutron pulse reached
    the moderator

The description of the pulse\_height field is confusing. It refer to
events\_per\_pulse, which has length j but it's own index is of length
i, so something is screwy.

I suggest renaming time\_of\_flight to event\_time and pulse\_time to
frame\_time and you have something that can be used either for
continuous or pulsed sources.

-   event\_time\[i\]: time relative to the start of the frame
-   pixel\_number\[i\]: detector which registered the event
-   frame\_time\[j\]: time relative to the start of the measurement
-   events\_per\_frame\[j\]: as before
-   pulse\_height\[i,k?\]: detector voltages

The frame\_time for continuous sources presumably refers to the time
when the detector was turned on after moving the motors during a scan
for multi-point scans. When scanning continously (a potentially useful
measurement during alignment operations), the frame time would more
likely refer to the pulses from the motor position detectors.

Conclusion
----------

01/2015: There was no activity on this for a long time. There is a
NXevent\_data base class and both SNS and ISIS are writing data files
using that base class. Please consult the documentation of the base
class for the current state.
