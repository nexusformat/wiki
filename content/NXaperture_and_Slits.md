The actual *NXaperture* base class is far t0o complex for most of the
apertures used at synchrotron facilities. Currently the most commonly
used aperture types are

-   pinholes
-   2 or 4 blade slits.

From the current implementation of *NXaperture* it would be rather
difficult to obtain relevant quantities like the size of the slit gap or
the offsets of the gap. There are basically two ways how to face this
problem

-   redesign *NXaperture*
-   or introduce new classes for more specific aperture types.

Which of them is appropriate for us should be the topic of this
discussion.

Introducing new classes
-----------------------

#### Pinholes - *NXpinhole*

![c|A pinhold in the
beam.](pinhole_2.png "fig:c|A pinhold in the beam.") Pinholes are most
probably the simplest apertures available. The only parameter of
importance is the diameter of the pinhole and its position with respect
to the beam (as shown in the image). From this sketch one could easily
deduce a new class *NXpinhole* with the following parameters:

    NXpinhole
      diameter:NX_LENGTH
      depends_on:NX_CHAR

The first parameter *diameter* describes the diameter of the pinhole
while the depends\_on references the last element of the chain of
transformations to position the center of the pinhole.

#### Slits - *NXslit*

![A four-blade slit system.](slit.png "fig:A four-blade slit system.")
Two or four blade slits are the most common apertures used at
synchrotrons. In this example a 4-blade slit is shown. The most
important parameter for such a system is the size of the aperture
determined by the positions of the blades. A base class *NXslit* could
look like this

    NXslit
      x_gap:NX_LENGTH
      y_gap:NX_LENGTH
      depends_on:NX_CHAR

The gaps are given in the local reference frame of the slit system,
which is defined by the transformation chain referenced by the
*depends\_on* field. The *depends\_on* places the center of the slit
assembly into the coordinate system. *NXslit* basically describes a
rectangular aperture. The positions of the individual slit blades are
not included in the definition of the base class.

#### What happens to *NXaperture*

The original *NXaperture* remains unchanged (for the sake of
compatibility) and can still be used for all kind of more complex
apertures which cannot be represented by the the new classes.
