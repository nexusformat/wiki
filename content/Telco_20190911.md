Release
-------
Release issues to be worked on before we make the next release:
https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/8
   * Aim for February/March release.
   * Why are [PDB](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/614/files) and [NXptycho](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/pull/628/files) not visible in the current master?
[Release Procedure](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/wiki/Release-Procedure)

AB points out that [NXmx](http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/classes/applications/NXmx.html) and [NXdetector](http://download.nexusformat.org/doc/html/classes/base_classes/NXdetector.html) document the use of beam_center_x and beam_center_y differently from each other.
   
Prune Stale Branches
------
Branches that are not ahead of master at all give no value and have now been deleted.

Code Camp
------
Maybe PJ can organise something at Argonne in mid-November. Otherwise we should organise a virtual event. We certainly should do plenty of cleaning up in github for the next release.

HDF5 Workshop
---------
No further specific issues.

Other Business
--------
   * SC to get some more graphic design input for a new logo, especially with more "corporate" colours and including a mu.
   * Next meeting aiming for mid-October.
