NIAC 2020
----------

   * NOBUGS is going to postponed until next year (probably May)
   * Will need to do the meeting remotely if we stick to the October dates.
   * Will probably need to run it more like a teleconference with a series of teleconferences to organise the topics and then break up into interest groups.
   * Need to have some discussion on the mailing list to make sure everyone is well informed.
   * Could still follow the NOBUGS meeting, maybe even doing both an October virtual meeting and a 2021 meeting with NOBUGS.
   * MK to check the previous NIAC minutes to clarify email voting procedures.
