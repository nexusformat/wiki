Monochromatic Single Crystal Diffractometer with Position Sensitive Detector
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Instrument definition for a single crystal diffractometer at a
monochromatic neutron or X-ray beam. This is the version for a position
sensitive detector. Such an instrument can be used in various ways:

In one mode the instrument is driven to each reflection individually and
a short scan is performed in order to measure the reflections intensity.
In such cases each reflection should be stored in either separate files
or in separate entries as they constitute separate measurements.

In another mode a larger range in omega is scanned, saving detector data
at each step. This is similar to the way PX instruments operate. In such
a case, omit the Miller indices in the sample group.

A Eulerian cradle is assumed. If you do not have this, or you are using
a rotation camera, feel free to adapt the Nxsample group.

The definition assumes the measurement to be an omega - two-theta or
omega scan of a given reflection.

This definition is fairly minimal and shall cater for standard data
reduction needs. If your most favourite items are missing, feel free to
add them. If you think something is missing which is required for
standard data reduction tasks, please contact the maintainer of this
definition.

If you to choose to store PSD scans in separate files or separate
entries, it is the users responsibility to process the data in the right
order.

NP is again the number of scan points
