The 2022 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for the week of June 13-17th. Details will be posted soon.

## Issues and pull requests

To help the upcoming code camp organize and track its work, a GitHub project has
been created.  You can [add additional issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/1?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen)
by dragging each to the "To do" column.  The list is filled from any of the
repositories that are connected to the project.  As a start, existing open pull
requests were added to the appropriate column based on inspection of the comments in each.

If you have some other matter to add, create an issue in the appropriate repository
and then you can add it to this project.  If it should be considered for the next
release of the definitions repository, add the issue (or pull request) to the
[NXDL 2022.06](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/12)
