### DOIs via Zenodo

The suggestion to create DOIs for definition releases was converted to a ticket.
Seems like a good idea.

### NIAC & NOBUGS Preparations

TSR to submit a state-of-the-union talk. Topics would be:
* (no longer so) new website/wiki
* OFF geometry
* Mantid Geometry support - weights?
* Axes (Diamond)
* STEM NeXus
* Grants
* PDB, if ready

For the NIAC MB has two more topics than what is already registered as NIAC tickets:
* NXtyco
* CSG volumes


New officers need to be elected.

## AOB

The 2018.8 milestone release had no real improvements commited against it.
We move all open and closed ticket to the next one (2019.1).

The NIAC can decide on priorties for the open tickets and
establish a roadmap for NeXus for the slightly longer term.
