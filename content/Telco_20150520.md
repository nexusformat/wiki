Minutes
-------

Present: EW, TSR, HJB, MK, MB, Andreas Foerster, PJ (second half)

Contacts with LCLS II for file formats made. Touch base Skype call
arranged. Update at next Telco.

CMake: Good progress made by Eugen on Definitions. Removal of items
agreed. However we do need a roadmap for providing a working validation
tool. NXFeatures are on the way, but still experimental.

Discussion on foreign pull requests: It is great that we get work done
for free. We need to be careful though about copyright (notices are
intact).

NXmx: During code development at DLS question came up to clarify named
items in nxdl. Handbook says maxOccurs is unbounded, which makes no
sense for named items. Documentation will be improved (Mark B was
volunteered). Followup question: What do we do for names of items that
can have multiple instances? name\_NNNN? Consensus was we mostly should
not be fixing names in that case. A documentation proposal might be
coming.

Andreas proposed a single angle increment value for goniometer axes that
move during shutterless MX scans. Preference was to have a per frame
value, with separate start\_something and end\_something. There was a
proposal floating around in Diamond at one point. Mark B to dig out and
forward to HJB, who will process that into a template proposal for
Dectris. Will revisit next time.

For those Dectris templates: Can we have a IEEE NaN fill value for data
that is to be provided outside of the detector later. Looks like we can.
We'll check.

Clarification: Detector origin is supposed to be the first pixel in the
data. Needs to be documented prominently. Worth checking documentation
for other omissions. Task for everyone.

Will discuss other items and relative paths for depends\_on at the next
meeting, which will be [Telco 20150603](Telco_20150603.html "wikilink")
