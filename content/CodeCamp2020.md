Agenda
------

Goal:  Resolve issues to prepare next [release of NXDL](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/8).

Considerations:

* We should take this opportunity to provide the standard *Introduction to NeXus* as a public presentation.
* We should allow time for an open, working lunch on one of the days to interact with the community able to attend.
* If someone wishes to make any other public presentation, either during, before, or after the Code Camp, please contact the host.
