The 2020 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for 3 days in January 2020:
Jan 21 (Tuesday) - 23 (Thursday).
The code camp will take place at the [Advanced Photon Source](https://www.aps.anl.gov), 
[Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov), IL, USA (near Chicago).  

(We used an [online poll](https://doodle.com/poll/kf5xvbudzf2ccg6s) to help decide the exact dates.)

## Purpose

NeXus periodically convenes a Code Camp to
develop NeXus software components through intense effort by small groups
working on specific projects and tasks. It is expected that those
attending the 2020 NeXus Code Camp will already have a strong foundation
and understanding in aspects of the NeXus software and come ready with
knowledge, tools, and ideas to make significant progress during the
event. 

Specific projects and tasks are described on the 
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestones).
Issues for consideration at 2020 NeXus Code Camp will be added to the Code Camp's
[Topics page](https://www.nexusformat.org/CodeCamp2020-topics.html)
([edit here](https://github.com/nexusformat/wiki/edit/master/content/CodeCamp2020-topics.md)).
These issues will be prioritized on the first day for handling at the Code Camp.

(For more info on code camps, try searching Google for “code camp” or
“codeathon”. Events such as the [EPICS
Codeathon](https://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/meetings/codeathon.php) would be
reasonable templates for this NeXus code camp.)

Since this is not to be a meeting of the full NIAC, no business matters
can be resolved.

### Goal

[milestone](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/milestone/8)
to prepare next [release of NXDL](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/693).

Suggestions:

* We should take this opportunity to provide the standard *Introduction to NeXus* as a public presentation.

  - this took longer than expected (about 90 minutes)
  - we used a [shared Google Docs spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fFmKNXikbNSG9uAbkhS2UmtvJpQRxQmWyDlSRthE9cA/edit?usp=sharing) to list GitHub issues, assign priorities, note workers, and report status
- AOB?
- work on issues

### Day 2

## Minutes for the meeting

We don't typically record minutes for the Code Camps.  
Rather, the work progress is recorded in the GitHub 
issue trackers for the various repositories involved.

We'll note here certain progress items or any questions or recommendations for the NIAC.

* We are looking to [publish the manual through GitHub Pages](https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions/issues/663): [https://manual.nexusformat.org](https://manual.nexusformat.org)
* We made excellent progress on the *Gold Standard for NXmx*, helping both the MX, FEL, and synchrotron communities and the vendor support.
