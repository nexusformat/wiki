<h1>Linking External Files<a class="headerlink" href="#linking-external-files" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>This discussion is on how to access external files from within a given
NeXus files. This defeats one guiding principle of NeXus: to have
everything in one file, somewhat. However, having everything in one file
can mean replicating large time-of-flight empty can or vanadium datasets
in each data file. In such cases it would be nice to access
transparently an external file holding such data. This page discusses
some of the implementation issues of such a scheme.</p>
<section id="storing-external-file-information">
<h2>Storing External File Information<a class="headerlink" href="#storing-external-file-information" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Somehow the information that an external file has to be accessed must be
stored within the parent NeXus file. Given the feature set of NeXus, I
suggest storing this information as an attribute of a NeXus object. It
would be sensible to restrict this attribute to NeXus groups only. As
the name of the attribute, I suggest <strong>mount</strong> following the example of
HDF-5. The data content of this attribute should be a URL pointing to
the requested file. This not only follows the fashion of the day but
also gives a lot of freedom to implement various file access strategies
and even file formats. As it might be necessary to specify alternative
locations for a given external file, I suggest allowing multiple URLs
separated by :: It must be :: because a single colon can be part of a
valid URL.</p>

<h2>Implementing External File Access At The NAPI Level<a class="headerlink" href="#implementing-external-file-access-at-the-napi-level" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Various issues have to be adressed when implementing external file
access. The most important one is how to transparently navigate the file
hierarchy resulting from external linking. In order to handle this, I
suggest changing NXhandle. Currently NXhandle maps to a pNexusFunction
structure. Navigating the file hierarchy becomes possible when NXhandle
is modified to become a stack of pNexusFunction structures. All
functions in napi.c would need to be changed to access the bottom
element of this stack. NXopengroup would then be modified to check for
the mount attribute. If the mount attribute is found, NXopengroup would
open the file specified in the URL and push the new pNexusFunction onto
the stack. Likewise NXclosegroup has to check if it is leaving a mounted
file and if this is the case, has to close the file and to pop the
expired pNexusFunction structure from the stack. If we choose to
implement external linking on datasets too a similar scheme would have
to be implemented for NXopendata and NXclosedata.</p>

<section id="actually-accessing-the-external-file">
<h2>Actually Accessing The External File<a class="headerlink" href="#actually-accessing-the-external-file" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section is about schemes for actually opening an external file as
specified by a URL. Accessing an external NeXus file within the same
file system is the easiest case: just open the path! It becomes
moderately more complex when accessing NeXus files which are available
through the http or ftp series of protocols. In that case, I suggest
downloading such a file through a suitable library and accessing it in
the cache area. Such a copy and access method would also help minimise
the download of possibly large files as a cache lookup can be
implemented to precede an actual download. A good library to choose for
http and ftp style downloads might be <a class="reference external" href="http://curl.haxx.se/">http://curl.haxx.se/</a> cURL. A
drawback of such a solution (or any general URL solution) is that
another meta data API would be required in order to keep such
information as usernames, passwords and possibly proxy servers.</p>
<p>The degree of implementation complexity increases when we wish to
support general URL schemes or wish to support files not in a supported
NeXus physical file format. In such cases, a means would be needed to
dynamically add URL handlers to the NeXus-API. However, if we restrict
ourselves to the copy, cache and access scheme outlined above, another
easily implemented option is to call external utility programs for
downloading files into the cache. This solution will appeal to the unix
crowd (including the Macs who are also unix), but might leave the
utility deprived Windows users in a tight spot. The most ambitious
implementation would be to allow loading both file format and URL
handlers dynamically into the NeXus-API. Both are possible but will
cause stability and maintainance problems due to the reliance on many
shared libraries.</p>

<section id="summary-and-open-issues">
<h2>Summary And Open Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#summary-and-open-issues" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Summing it up, implementing external linking is definitely possible and
implementable within a reasonable amount of time. Group attributes would
have to be implemented first though. Open questions include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Do we restrict external linking to groups?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the suggested path to an implementation acceptable? There might
be others.</p></li>
<li><p>Which level do we implement?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Local NeXus files only?</p></li>
<li><p>Download, cache, access through a library included with the
NeXus-API? Which library then?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>cURL?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Download and cache delegated to external programs?</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamically loadable URL Handlers?</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamically loadable physical file format handlers?</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Your question here!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>My two cents worth of opinion: shared libraries always annoy me, I like
big statically built things, especially as disk space is cheap these
days. I would implement a local disk access version first in order to
get the mechanics right, followed by a version implementing the
download, cache and access NeXus files scheme using cURL. Both versions
would restrict external linking to groups.</p>
