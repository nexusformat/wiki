         :name: nexus-code-camp---june-2023
         :class: page-title

      The June 2023 NeXus Code Camp is scheduled for four days split
      over two weeks of June 2023, 15-16 & 20-21, and will focus on
      fixing issues and discussing proposed additions.

      To help the upcoming code camp organize and track its work, a
      GitHub project has been created. You can `add additional issues
      and pull
      requests <https://github.com/orgs/nexusformat/projects/3?add_cards_query=is%3Aopen>`__
      by dragging each to the "To do" column. The list is filled from
      any of the repositories that are connected to the project. As a
      start, existing open pull requests were added to the appropriate
      column based on inspection of the comments in each.

      If you have some other matter to add, create an issue in the
      appropriate repository and then you can add it to this project.

      Regular video meetings will be run over the course of June 15-16 &
      20-21 in order to aid communication. Since we are spread over the
      globe, our normal work schedules are not going to overlap
      perfectly and participants are encouraged to attend whichever
      sessions reasoably fit their own work/life schedule. Sessions
      **B** and **D** provide the best opportunities to get everyone
      together and participants are encouraged to make an effort to join
      these sessions.

      All sessions will use the same Zoom meeting:
